Cir cumstances that can bring on shyness\nY ou may  feel shy in most socia l situations or only during part icular ones. Situations in which people commonly feel shy include\nmeeting new people;\nhaving to work a room and mingle;\ninteracting with people you find intimidating and high-status (for\nexample, asking a professor to reconsider a grade she gave you on a\npaper);\ninteracting with people whose opinion you really care about and\nwhom you want to make a good impression on;\nbeing put on the spot (for example, being handed a microphone out\nof the blue and asked to record a video message at a wedding);\nbeing the center of attention or doing something that draws attention\nto yourself (for example, being called on in class, wearing flashy\nclothes, calling down a hall to get a friend\u2019 s attention);having to perform (for example, giving a speech or telling a story\nwhen everyone at the table is listening intently);\nconfronting someone or being assertive (for example, telling a friend\nyou don\u2019 t like it when they tease you constantly , telling a coworker\nyou don\u2019 t want to help them move on the weekend);\nduring interactions where you may upset the other person (for\nexample, turning down a request, asking someone not to do\nsomething annoying, asking a person to go out of their way for you);\ntalking on the phone or having to leave a voicemail. Appr oaching social situations\nShy people dread many common  social settings or interactions b ecause they\naren\u2019 t su re how to act or they ar en\u2019 t sure how they\u2019ll be receive d by others. See if any of these responses for handling social situations sound familiar:\ncompletely avoiding social situations or interactions that make you\nfeel shy  (for example, not going to a party , crossing the stre et to\navoid ha ving to stop and chat w ith an acquaintance, sending an email\nwhen a phone ca ll would be easier , not following up to hang out with\nsomeone you met the other day);\nbailing out of so cial situations early (for example, making an e xcuse\nto en d a  convers ation after a few  minutes, leaving a pub becaus e you\nfeel so out of your element);\npartially avoiding social situations or interactions (for example, being\npresent in a group conversation but not saying anything);\nbeing less likely to take soc ial risks (for example, not a sking\nsomeone to hang out, not a pproaching a stranger to start a\nconversation, holding back a mildly controversial opinion).Overall consequences\nB eing shy does more than keep you home at night. It also causes these\noverarching problems:\nThe self-doubt and inhibition inherent in shyness prevent you from\nshowing your full personality .

The Pareto principle states that 20 percent of \nthe tasks we do give 80 percent of the rewards or satisfaction (Reh, 2008). Also referred to as the 80/20 Rule, this principle suggests that in-dividuals should focus on one or two signi\ufb01  -\ncant tasks that are worth the time invested in them. According to this principle, out of every ten responsibilities listed, only two will pro-duce recognizable gains. These tasks should be given attention and time. (These two tasks will most likely fall in the A category, suggest-ing that completion of C, and even B, items may prove unfruitful in the long run.)\nc. Sometimes it is dif\ufb01  cult to differentiate among \nresponsibilities, all of which seem important, what to do \ufb01\n rst. One answer is to employ \nStephen Covey\u2019s important-versus-urgent \nmethod (Box 15.1) as highlighted in his best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Divide your responsibilities for the day (or week) into four boxes. Note that peo-ple tend to direct their energies toward box IV (Not urgent, Not important) because these responsibilities look quick, easy, and perhaps enjoyable. Covey suggests that one\u2019s overrid-ing attention should go to the box labeled II (Important but not Urgent) because this will yield the highest results. Box I (Important and Urgent) needs adequate time, but this is not where the majority of your attention should be placed, for it will only lead to a reactionary lifestyle. Covey suggests that it\u2019s not time that needs to be managed but ourselves that need attention. Quadrant II is the key to effective personal management. 2.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>He re I go\u2026 Ah!</DOCUMENT>", "question": "1.

Try to include whatever \nfragments of a particular dream you can re-call. Include the use of colors. Interpretations\nInterpretations are the hardest component of art ther-apy. They are dif\ufb01  cult because there is wide latitude for impressions and understanding the \ufb01  gures, colors, \nshapes, and sizes that have made their way onto paper. Jung once said that the most important factor in dream analysis is the patient\u2019s impressions because dreams are the creation of the dreamer. Drawings and sketches are no different when it comes to interpretation. As a cathartic experience, interpretations of drawings are secondary to simply getting feelings down on paper. Art therapists, and even psychologists who now use art therapy in their practices, engage in a fair amount of training to unders tand the commonalities, expressions \nof colors, and a host of other components of drawings \n(www.arttherapy.org). When inter preting the colors you have chosen, be careful to keep in mind both the context of the illustration and mood you were in when you drew the picture. For example, black is often used to represent death or grief, but for an African American, the color may also symbolize pride.

Persuasion is de\ufb01  ned as an attempt to\n  \nalter another person\u2019s attitude or behavior. It is believed by some scholars that all verbal expression is rooted in persuasion. When persuasion is used to win a con\ufb02  ict at the expense of others, it is viewed as negative. But persuasion can be a positive style as well. In the initial stage of the con\ufb02  ict-resolution \nprocess, all voices need to be heard. Persuasion may include the use of reason, emotional awareness, or motivation to get a point across. When used tact-fully, persuasion opens new lines of thinking, which can then be tools to resolve issues and pro-mote mutual agreement. 5. Dialogue. Dialogue is a verbal exchange of opin-ions, attitudes, facts, and perceptions that opens the doors to greater understanding of the nature of the problem. During the dialogue process, dis-cussions center on the costs and bene\ufb01  ts of solving \na problem. Dialogue involves the same steps as those employed for creative problem solving (see Chapter 13). In dialogue, negotiations are a means to a solution to which all parties feel they have made a contribution.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>The chapter defines the two\ntypes of empathy and explains their benefits, then of fers some suggestions\non how to cultivate it in yourself. E m p a t h y  d e f i n e d\nBroadly speakin g, empathy is th e ability to put yourself in another person\u2019 s\nshoes. There are two types:\nEmotional empathy  is the ability to pick up on  other people\u2019 s\nemotions and have an appropriate feeling in response. For example, if\nyour friend gets some upsetting news, you feel sympathetic for them\nand a bit sad yourself. Sometimes people refer to empathy as this\nability t o feel what another pe rson is feeling. At other times what\nthey me an by empathy is act ing on those feelings and sho wing\nconcern and support. Cognitive empathy  is the ability to more logically get inside\nsomeone\u2019 s head and take on the ir perspective. Y ou don\u2019 t necessarily\nfeel what they\u2019re feeling, but yo u can rationally understand how they\nsee the world (f or example, a c ertain book doesn\u2019 t bother you, but\nyou can grasp how it would be of fensive to someone with more\ntraditional values). Again, some  people see this kind of empathy assimply being able to deduce w hat\u2019 s going through another person\u2019 s\nmind, w hile oth ers don\u2019 t think someone is being empathetic u nless\nthey ef fectively put their conclusions to use. Of course, there\u2019 s overlap between the two because you can often use one\nto g ive you info rmation about the other (for example, knowing someone\u2019 s\nworldview and history helps you emotionally empathize with why a certain\nevent makes them so angry). B e n e f i t s  o f  e m p a t h y\nOverall, empath y helps you to discern people\u2019 s needs, emotions, values,\ninterests, and overall personalit y . It doesn\u2019 t take much ef fort to see how\nthese skills could be useful in social situations:\nIn conve rsations, it helps you a nswer questions like: What are they\nlooking for from the exchange?</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>I know you would dig the plot for me.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Having a broad  game plan\ncan help  becaus e it simplifies a nd clarifies what you have to think about,\ngives you the confidence that co mes from knowing you\u2019re using a method\nthat wor ks, and provides some reliable, simple starting material so you can\npractice. It\u2019 s good to have several approaches ready to go, and if one\ndoesn\u2019 t w ork, yo u can try anothe r . Y ou can also switch up broad approaches\nwithin a  single conversation as it evolves. Y ou don\u2019 t have to app ly only one\nstrategy to every person or situation. The broad conversation goals th at were covered earlier in the chapter are\none way  to give yourself some direction (\u201cI\u2019m going to ask about their\ninterests and try to find one we have in common,\u201d \u201cMy grandpa is\ninterested to know what I\u2019ve be en up to lately , so I\u2019ll focus on  telling him\nwhat\u2019 s b een new in my life since I last saw him\u201d). Here are some other\napproaches you can use:\nAppr oach #1: Be inter ested in and curious about other people, and\nmake it your goal to find out what\u2019 s fascinating and unique about them\nThis is the most popular general  approach you\u2019ll hear people me ntion when\nit comes to making conversation. It comes up again and again, going back\nto classic books on people skills like How to W in Fr iends and Influence\nPeople . Th e ide a is primarily to be som eone who asks questions and li stens\nto the answers, which leads to focusing the discussion on the other person. Y our \u201cmission\u201d in the convers ation is to discover what makes the other\nperson interesting. Y ou don\u2019 t need to only listen to  or talk about the other person the entire\ntime; yo u should bring up things about yourself and share  your own\nopinions when relevant. Generally focus the conversation on your partner ,\nbut not to the po int where you share nothing about yourself an d become afor gettable nonentity that just helps other people talk. The underlying assumption abou t this approach is that everyone\u2019 s favorite\nsubject is themselves, and that people like someone who take s a genuine\ninterest in them and the things they have to say . People also tend to feel\ngood ab out a conversation in which they can talk about aspects of\nthemselves that they\u2019re proud o f and passionate about. Another line you\u2019ll\noften he ar in regard to this strategy is that you\u2019ll be more succe ssful taking\nan in terest in other people than you will be by trying to get them interested\nin you. This approach predisposes you to adopt a positive, friendly frame of\nmind. It s basic premise implies that everyone is worth talking to if you dig\npast any preconceptions you ma y have of them. And because you\u2019re likely\nto find somethin g interesting about the other person if you look for it, it\nends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy . Appr oach #2: T alk in terms of the other person\u2019 s inter ests\nFocusing on the other person\u2019 s interests is similar to the approach above, in\nthat you\u2019re mainly listening and  the conversation is based around the other\nperson and things they like discussing. This approach is not exactly the\nsame. The approach above is more general and is about finding people\u2019 s\ngood traits, whatever they may be. This one is more about specifically\ntrying to find out what the other person is interested in talking about,\nwhether it\u2019 s a hobby or a life decision they\u2019re wrestling with, and centering\nthe con versation on that. Y ou take an interest in their interest, ask\nthoughtful questions, and listen as they tell you about it. The limitations of being an interested listenerBoth of these listening / other -person-centric approaches can work very\nwell and  are essential to have in your toolbox. At the same t ime, their\nef fectiveness is sometimes oversold.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

Contrary to what you might think, creativity is not solely \na right-brain function. Rather, it is a partnership between the right brain, the house of the imagination, and the left brain, the source of organization. There are many reasons why the creative process becomes sti\ufb02  ed. Most of these have to do with the inability to access the functional pow-ers of the right brain, the overbearing powers of the left brain, or a combination of the two. What is needed is a balance of right- and left-brain cognitive skills. Lack of balance is induced by attitudes and other obstacles that block the creative process. These attitudes are called men-tal blocks, or in von Oech\u2019s terms, mental locks. Von Oech describes ten mental blocks in his book A Whack on the Side of the Head, each an attitude debilitating to the cre-ative process. Four of the most common pertaining to stress management are The Right Answer (explorer), I\u2019m Not Creative (artist), Don\u2019t Be Foolish (judge), and To Err Is Wrong (warrior).

It is unresolved fear and anger that creates the illusion of separation. The premise of prayer as a coping technique rests on faith: the belief that each person is connected to a divine source (however this is named or described). Faith in a higher power, the ultimate source, can certainly be tested in times of stress. Types of Prayer\nWhen it comes to prayer, the styles are countless. Perhaps most common to many people is a recited prayer (much like a poem) that draws our attention from the self to the higher self.

Art therapy has its roots in Freudian and \nJungian psychology, where illustrations were used to aid in understanding unconscious thoughts. I In 1969, the American Art Therapy Association was \nestablished to educate and certify people in the skills of art therapy. Art therapy has since been introduced into a variety of settings, including counseling cen-ters, hospitals, and addiction treatment centers, as well as nontraditional settings such as corporate wellness centers. It has proved an effective coping technique for all types of people to get in touch with their emotions in a nonverbal way. I Art therapy is described as the creative use of art \nto provide for nonverbal expression and communi-cation through which to foster self-awareness and personal growth. I Every stroke, every color, every detail has some rel-\nevant meaning at the unconscious level. I There are varying opinions on the use of materials \nfor art therapy, meaning that there is no preferred method. Crayons, pastels, colored pencils, \ufb01  nger \npaint, and clay are all possibilities. Art therapists do suggest that a wide variety of colors be available. Colors provide speci\ufb01  c meaning to thoughts and unconscious messages.

Typically, during national tra-gedies, black-humor jokes surface as a way to cope with the gruesome reality of death, as was the case when jokes circulated immediately after the Columbia space shuttle explosion in 2003. Some of the best examples of black humor can be found in \ufb01 lms and videos like the infamous Harold and \nMaude and the more recent Bad Santa and Little \nMiss Sunshine. Much of the comic wit used in the tele vision series M*A*S*H and Scrubs expressed \nvarious shades of black humor. Cartoonists, includ-ing Gary Larson, also make light of this phenome-non in their illustrations. The dead as well as the living seem to have the \nlast laugh, as expressed in the last words of American humorist Dorothy Parker (etched on her tombstone), \u201cPardon my dust.\u201d In a survey of gravestone epitaphs, Louis Schafer (1990) discov-ered that cemeteries are not devoid of tongue-in-cheek black humor either, as illustrated in the following examples:\nJohn Strange\nHere lies an honest lawyer.This is Strange.

None, however, is as compelling as that of Augusto and Michaela Odone, which is the epit-ome of information seeking as a coping strategy. The story began in 1984, when their son, Lorenzo, then \n6 years old, was sent home from school for displaying hyperactive behavior. As days turned into months, addi-tional symptoms appeared, and eventually Lorenzo was diagnosed with the newly named and little understood adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a lethal genetic disease of dysfunctional nerve tissue, resulting from an extremely high number of very long fatty-acid chains in the blood. Lorenzo was given a maximum of 2 years to live. But his parents did not accept Lorenzo\u2019s death sentence. Upon learning of the prognosis for their son, they took turns going to the National Library of Medicine to research ALD and staying home to care for Lorenzo. With persistence, willpower, luck, and what Augusto \ncalls a \u201cwhole lot of love,\u201d their search for clues not only enlightened the medical community about the dynamics involved in the etiology of the disease, but led to the creation of a medication, Lorenzo\u2019s Oil, which arrested the progression of the disease. Lorenzo\u2019s Oil is now used to treat this disease in children all over the world. A lawyer for the World Bank, Augusto has earned an hon-\norary doctorate in medicine for his achievement.

Each cog-nitive deciphering process begins with an interpretation  \nof the stimulus that comes into any of the \ufb01  ve (possibly \nsix) senses to determine its threat potential. In simple terms, stimuli can be interpreted as either threats or non-threats. Resulting attitudes can be labeled in one of the three ways: (1) defensive (negative), (2) neutral (innocu-ous), or (3) offensive (positive). Fragments of informa-tion, as well as memories of previous similar experiences, are then manipulated in a process that results in the accessing and utilization of either left- (analytical) or right- (receptive) brain cognitive functions, or a combi-nation of both. (For a more detailed explanation, see Chapter 18.) In the \ufb01  nal outcome, perceptions and atti-tudes are by-products of the interpretation of all sensory information. It is both the manipulation of stimuli and the subsequent interpretation process that are targeted in cognitive restructuring to convert negative thoughts into neutral or positive ones.

More than 14,000 questionnaires were returned, and responses varied as much as the styles of jokes printed. Humor, like beauty, is a relative concept. The study concluded that sexual humor was the most popular topic of jest, with ethnic humor running a close second. Humor scholar Avner Ziv (1984) offers two reasons why sexual humor remains so popular. First, the craving for sexual humor compensates for the con-tinuous desire to physically satisfy this basic human drive. Second, sexual humor may compensate for the disappointment of unmet sexual expectations. Comic relief is currently used as a mode of therapy in \nmany rehabilitation programs, including the treatment of physical trauma, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Psy-chologists who recognize the effectiveness of humor and utilize comic relief with their patients identify it as both an assessment tool, to indicate values, inner feel-ings, and meaning in life, and a therapeutic tool, to encourage a cathartic release of emotions. In psycho-therapy, it is the patient\u2019s own use of humor that is nur-tured and encouraged; it is not initiated by the therapist. When patients begin to joke about their conditions or predicaments, it is acknowledged as a breakthrough in the emotional self-healing process. Once manifested, the practice of comic relief is encouraged during laugh-able moments. Humor has been found to be very effec-tive in aiding patients through the transitions of the many stages of recovery. Just like other coping techniques that can prove ineffec-\ntive for resolution, the power of humor can be abused. Negative and offensive humor such as racial, ethnic, and sexist humor, as well as sarcasm in both its delivery and reception, do not lend themselves to satisfaction as coping mechanisms. Negative humor may in\ufb02  ate self-esteem, \nbut it is a false in\ufb02  ation with no lasting value. Humor can also be used as a means of seeking approval by controlling other people\u2019s attitudes and making them feel good. Used in this manner, humor takes on an addictive quality, where each laugh becomes a \u201c\ufb01  x\u201d leading to the next laugh. Thus, humor employed to win the approval of others takes on the quality of codependent behavior. In a study by Fisher and Fisher (1983) investigating the per-sonalities of comedians, it was observed that many pro-fessional comedians and humorists were raised in less-than-enviable environments, including homes with alcoholic parents (Carol Burnett), orphanages (Charlie Chaplin, Art Buchwald), or broken families. In these cases, the use of humor often brought recognition, approval, and a feeling of self-validation. In her book It\u2019s \nAlways Some thing, comedian Gilda Radner (1989) described her use of comedy as an occasionally negative behavior: \u201cComedy is very controlling\u2014you are making people laugh. You feel completely in control when you hear a wave of laughter coming back that you have caused.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Maybe\nthey\u2019d b e up for doing something one weekend.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Scheduling (Box 15.2). Scheduling is time alloca-\ntion for prioritized responsibilities, or the skill of  \nmatching a speci\ufb01  \nc task or responsibility with a \ndesignated time period in which to accomplish it. Time-management experts use the three-C\u2019s method and the three-P\u2019s method for scheduling. The three-C\u2019s method consists of clocks, the desig-nation of time periods for short-term time man-agement; calendars, for weekly, monthly, and even yearly forecasts of goals and responsibilities; and completion times/dates of designated goals and responsibilities. The three-P\u2019s method is planning, implementing a schedule of tasks; priorities, doing a regular check on the relative importance of tasks; and perhaps most important, pacing, or the rate at which each task is performed. The following scheduling techniques are advocated. Remember, though, that \ufb02  exibility in scheduling is essential, or these time-management techniques will cause stress rather than reduce it. a.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Thirty jokes were printed along with a question-naire to gauge readers\u2019 opinions of the jokes\u2019 quality and laughability. More than 14,000 questionnaires were returned, and responses varied as much as the styles of jokes printed. Humor, like beauty, is a relative concept. The study concluded that sexual humor was the most popular topic of jest, with ethnic humor running a close second. Humor scholar Avner Ziv (1984) offers two reasons why sexual humor remains so popular. First, the craving for sexual humor compensates for the con-tinuous desire to physically satisfy this basic human drive. Second, sexual humor may compensate for the disappointment of unmet sexual expectations. Comic relief is currently used as a mode of therapy in \nmany rehabilitation programs, including the treatment of physical trauma, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Psy-chologists who recognize the effectiveness of humor and utilize comic relief with their patients identify it as both an assessment tool, to indicate values, inner feel-ings, and meaning in life, and a therapeutic tool, to encourage a cathartic release of emotions. In psycho-therapy, it is the patient\u2019s own use of humor that is nur-tured and encouraged; it is not initiated by the therapist. When patients begin to joke about their conditions or predicaments, it is acknowledged as a breakthrough in the emotional self-healing process. Once manifested, the practice of comic relief is encouraged during laugh-able moments. Humor has been found to be very effec-tive in aiding patients through the transitions of the many stages of recovery. Just like other coping techniques that can prove ineffec-\ntive for resolution, the power of humor can be abused. Negative and offensive humor such as racial, ethnic, and sexist humor, as well as sarcasm in both its delivery and reception, do not lend themselves to satisfaction as coping mechanisms. Negative humor may in\ufb02  ate self-esteem, \nbut it is a false in\ufb02  ation with no lasting value. Humor can also be used as a means of seeking approval by controlling other people\u2019s attitudes and making them feel good. Used in this manner, humor takes on an addictive quality, where each laugh becomes a \u201c\ufb01  x\u201d leading to the next laugh. Thus, humor employed to win the approval of others takes on the quality of codependent behavior. In a study by Fisher and Fisher (1983) investigating the per-sonalities of comedians, it was observed that many pro-fessional comedians and humorists were raised in less-than-enviable environments, including homes with alcoholic parents (Carol Burnett), orphanages (Charlie Chaplin, Art Buchwald), or broken families. In these cases, the use of humor often brought recognition, approval, and a feeling of self-validation. In her book It\u2019s \nAlways Some thing, comedian Gilda Radner (1989) described her use of comedy as an occasionally negative behavior: \u201cComedy is very controlling\u2014you are making people laugh.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>b. The Pareto principle states that 20 percent of \nthe tasks we do give 80 percent of the rewards or satisfaction (Reh, 2008). Also referred to as the 80/20 Rule, this principle suggests that in-dividuals should focus on one or two signi\ufb01  -\ncant tasks that are worth the time invested in them. According to this principle, out of every ten responsibilities listed, only two will pro-duce recognizable gains. These tasks should be given attention and time. (These two tasks will most likely fall in the A category, suggest-ing that completion of C, and even B, items may prove unfruitful in the long run.)\nc. Sometimes it is dif\ufb01  cult to differentiate among \nresponsibilities, all of which seem important, what to do \ufb01\n rst. One answer is to employ \nStephen Covey\u2019s important-versus-urgent \nmethod (Box 15.1) as highlighted in his best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Divide your responsibilities for the day (or week) into four boxes. Note that peo-ple tend to direct their energies toward box IV (Not urgent, Not important) because these responsibilities look quick, easy, and perhaps enjoyable. Covey suggests that one\u2019s overrid-ing attention should go to the box labeled II (Important but not Urgent) because this will yield the highest results. Box I (Important and Urgent) needs adequate time, but this is not where the majority of your attention should be placed, for it will only lead to a reactionary lifestyle. Covey suggests that it\u2019s not time that needs to be managed but ourselves that need attention. Quadrant II is the key to effective personal management. 2.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Through repeated analysis and interpreta-tion of the works created by a host of patients from every conceivable background and with every health-related problem, some recurring archetypal images appear to represent speci\ufb01  c parts of one\u2019s personality.

As mentioned in Chapter 7 with regard to Einstein\u2019s view of spirituality, the most famous study on prayer was conducted by Randolph Byrd involving prayers for cardiac patients. Shying away from the word pray, researchers have coined the more scienti\ufb01  c term \u201cintercessory distant healing.\u201d To date, \nByrd\u2019s study has been replicated several times (Sicher and Targ, 1998; Harris et al., 1999), showing statistical signi\ufb01  cance beyond pure chance. A recent investigation into the ef\ufb01  cacy of prayer by Herbert Benson and colleagues (2006) at Harvard Medical Center found that intercessory prayer had no effect on cardiac bypass patients. Conversely, David Hodge from Arizona State University compiled empir-ical data from more than 17 recent studies on interces-sory prayer. Based on 12 criteria, he concluded that as an experimental intervention, prayer indeed had a small but signi\ufb01  cant effect. Prayer as a mode of compassion-ate intentionality is now being studied by several researchers including Marilyn Schlitz of the Institute of Noetic Sciences and Lynn McTaggart, author of the book The Intention Experiment (2007). You can visit \nMcTaggart\u2019s Web site and participate in this worldwide study by going to www.theintentionexperiment.com.

Like other coping techniques, though, information \nseeking can be a liability as well as an asset. Too much information can be as detrimental as too little because it can feed the imagination to create worst-case scenarios, which are then adopted as reality. Nevertheless, when you are confronted with a stressor that promotes fear of the unknown, information seeking can be your best strategy to begin to cope with this problem. Social Orchestration\nPerhaps the most common response to events or circum-stances that elicit the stress response is avoidance. Whereas avoidance of life-threatening events such as \ufb01  re is wise, avoidance of mental, emotional, and spiritual threats is not a viable option. Avoidance is a defense mechanism deeply rooted in the ancient \ufb02  ight response. It is popularly believed that if we avoid situations that cause fear or frustration, our lives will become simple and stress free. But what may seem like a quick \ufb01  x offers no permanent resolution, only further problems down the road.

A side from  spending more time with the group, here are some ways\nto move beyond that situation:\nWhen you\u2019re all hanging out, take time to break away from  your\noriginal friend(s ) and get to know the other members. Make it clear\nyou want to ge t to know every one better and not just accom pany\nyour buddy to the odd get-together . Get the other gr oup members\u2019 contact info. Aside from allowing you\nto get in touch with them and se nding another signal that you want to\nget to know the whole group, it also frees you from having to rely on\nyour original connection as yo ur sole means of hearing abou t the\ngroup\u2019 s plans. Y ou don \u2019 t have to become equally close to everyone or have the m all like\nyou to the same degree. Althoug h you want to get away from b eing seen as\nthe g uest of one  or two membe rs, you don\u2019 t have to become best friendswith every last person in the group. As long as a group on the whole wants\nyou around, it\u2019 s okay if your connection with a few member s is a little\nundeveloped. In most social circles, even though everyone gets along, some\nmembers are closer than others. If the group is big enough, th ere will be\nsubgroups withi n the lar ger one. When you\u2019re new to a group, try to be on\nfairly go od term s with everyone, but also look for the handful of members\nyou get along with best. As long as one of the subgroups ta kes you in,\nyou\u2019ll be seen as part of the bigger crowd. Step 3: Put in your time with the gr oup and deepen your r elationship\nwith everyone\nAfter yo u\u2019re hanging out with the group consistently , becoming more\nenmeshed in it i s mostly a matt er of time. If you put in enough  hours with\nthem, th ey\u2019ll nat urally start to think of you as a member . Y ou\u2019ll get to know\neveryone better , even if it\u2019 s onl y a group that gets together to party , rather\nthan have lots of intimate di scussions. Y ou\u2019ll share some memorable\nexperiences. Y ou\u2019ll become familiar with their private jokes and get in on\nthe grou nd floo r for new ones  that develop. Mostly this will  all happen\nautomatically , but you can speed the process along by consciously adapting\nand applying the ideas in the previous chapter on growing relationships. Understand that you may not feel like a full-fledged member for a\nwhile\nSometimes whe n you join a group, you\u2019ll feel like a full-on m ember right\naway . Alternatively , you might feel like a hanger -on for a few months. That\ndoesn\u2019 t n ecessarily mean the group doesn\u2019 t like you; if some members have\nknown e ach oth er for years and  years, they\u2019ll be more drawn toward each\nother and might unintentionally leave you out. Once you\u2019re hanging out\nwith the group on a regular b asis, you\u2019re in. Don\u2019 t discount that andconvince yourself you\u2019re still an outsider . Just keep showing u p and doing\nwhat yo u\u2019re doing; over time you\u2019ll get to know everyone better and\nbecome more of a core member . Accept that becoming part of a gr oup doesn\u2019t always work out\nExposure and familiarity genera lly increase bonds between people, but it\u2019 s\nnot guar anteed. Sometimes you \u2019ll join a group, feel on thin ic e the whole\ntime, and then eventually leave when you realize you\u2019ll nev er be fully\nincluded. Y ou need to be willing to go through this uncertain, r isky period. Any fee lings of being a second-tier member may only be temporary . If you\nreally fe el yours elf struggling, it may be a sign the group isn\u2019 t a good match\nfor you.29\nM a k i n g  F r i e n d s  i n  P a r t i c u l a r  S i t u a t i o n s\nU P  T O  THIS  POINT ,  th is section ha s covered a gen eral structure for how to\nmake fri ends. Here are some ad ditional suggestions for two situations that\npeople c ommonly have trouble with: making friends in college, and making\nfriends as an adult, after university , or when you\u2019re in a new city . M a k i n g  f r i e n d s  i n  c o l l e g e\nThe college environment is one of the easiest places to make friends. Y ou\u2019re\nsurrounded by thousands of pe ers, most of whom are open to meeting\npeople. Of course, that statement can seem like a slap in the face if you\u2019re at\nuniversity and struggling with your social life. Students have two main\nproblems with making friends in college:\nThey fel l into their friendships in high school and don\u2019 t know h ow to\ndeliberately make new ones. They fee l like everyone ef fortlessly made friends during the first few\nweeks o f school , but they didn\u2019 t, and they don\u2019 t know how to form a\nsocial circle after missing that window . Making friends  during day-to-day college life is mostly a matter of\nfollowing the concepts laid out in the previous chapters. Meet people in\nyour classes, at your dorm, thro ugh clubs and student associations, and at\nany part-time jobs you may have. T ake the initiative to inv ite possible\nfriends out, then try to continue to see them so the relationship c an develop.Of course, if you have problems with shyness or making conversation, you\nneed to put some time into tackling those issues too. Suggestions for making friends during your first few weeks of college\nWhen you begin university , you aren\u2019 t the only person who doesn\u2019 t know\nanyone. Most of the other students have left their friends and family behind\ntoo, and  need to make new friends. Here\u2019 s how to more easily m eet and get\nto know them:\nRealize pretty much everyone  feels a little nervous, unsure of\nthemselves, and overwhelmed when starting college. Most people are\njust putting on a brave face  because they mistakenly assume\neveryone else has their act together . Get to know som e people before the school year starts. If you go to\nan information session in the months leading up to the first sem ester ,\nget p eople\u2019 s contact info and keep in touch with them. If your major\nhas a group on a  social network, reach out to some of your soo n-to-\nbe c lassmates through it. If you\u2019re in town a few days before school\nstarts, arrange to meet up with anyone who\u2019 s also around. If it\u2019 s feasible, try to get famili ar with the campus and surrounding\narea ahead of tim e. Y ou\u2019ll feel more comfortable once school s tarts,\nand you \u2019ll be able to start a few conversations by of fering to help\nother students find their way around. If it\u2019 s a realistic option for yo u and you really want to get some\npractice with the university experience, go backpacking in another\ncountry beforeh and and stay in  hostels. The hostel life is similar to\nliving in a dorm, both practically and socially . Go t o as many Orientation W eek  events as you can. Y ou\u2019ll meet a lot\nof peop le, especially ones from your faculty . The rowdy , p arty-centric atmosph ere of the first week isn\u2019 t for everyone, but there\nshould be some non\u2013drinking-related events. If you\u2019re not into\npartying, you won\u2019 t be the only one, and you can seek out other\nstudents who are on the same page. If you live in a residence hall, g et to know the people on your floor . Go door to doo r and introduce yourself, or hang around the lo unge\nand talk  to whoever comes in. Drop in to visit your neighbors o n the\nfloors above and below you too. If you live at ho me or of f-campus, hang around school as mu ch as\nyou can . Y ou can\u2019 t meet new p eople if you\u2019re always holed up in\nyour own place. Chat to whoeve r you want to. The first few weeks are a social free-\nfor -all, a nd no one is going to look sideways at someone who\u2019 s being\noutgoing and trying to meet people. Realize it\u2019 s okay to tag along with groups of people or to go to\nOrientation W eek events alone. The group you\u2019re going with\nprobably just met a few days ag o, so it\u2019 s not like you\u2019re intruding on\ntheir clique. If you head to an event alone, you can start\nconversations w ith whomever you want because the whole point of\nthem is for people to mingle. One or two of yo ur fellow students may be vague acquaintances from\nyour high school.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Life of the party.

T ake an interest in other people and what they have to say . If you don\u2019 t have time to talk to someone, at least give them a\ncheerful greeting. H e l p  p e o p l e  f e e l  g o o d  a b o u t  t h e m s e l v e s\nWhen it  comes to this point, it\u2019 s less about actively trying to make people\nfeel good, and more about not saying anything that cuts them down. If you\npurposely try to build someone up by cooing over every little th ing they do,\nit can seem very transparent, patronizing, and manipulative. It\u2019 s more than\nenough to compliment someone or tell them you\u2019re impressed by something\nthey\u2019ve done when the opportu nity comes up naturally . Being a decent,\nfriendly person who\u2019 s intereste d in others also makes people feel good\nabout themselves. If you want to work on this poin t, you should put most of your e ner gy into\nnot being petty and undermining. Perhaps you know someone who isn\u2019 t a\nblatant j erk, but who\u2019 s always pe ppering their interactions with cutting littlecomments. They\u2019ll make snarky remarks, downplay or dismiss their\nfriends\u2019 accomplishments, and make \u201cjoking\u201d insults that are a little too\nstinging. Maybe  that person has social status and respect for another reason,\nbut no one would call them likable . When you act this way yourself, you\noften wo n\u2019 t even notice you\u2019re doing it. For example, a friend w ill tell you\nthey just  took up rock climbing, and before you know it, you fee l threatened\nby t he fact that  they have mo re adventurous hobbies than you and are\nbrushing it of f w ith \u201cY eah, that is a popular fad these days.\u201d Likable people\naren\u2019 t immune to acting petty , but they do it much less often.

They\u2019re\ngenuinely funny , they have inte resting things to say , they\u2019re fu n to go out\nwith, the y\u2019re good listeners, and so on.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "4.

P r a c t i c a l  c h a l l e n g e s\nEven wh en you  want to make changes in your social skills, the following\nchallenges can make it hard to s tart, and continue, working on t hem. These\nbarriers are all surmountable. \u201cI want to practice my social skills, but I get drained quickly in certain\nsituations.\u201d\nIt\u2019 s not uncommon for people to quickly become mentally drained when\nthey\u2019re socializi ng. They can ha ndle a dinner party conversation for an hour\nor two, but after  that they feel depleted, like they want to leave. After a few\nhours, they\u2019re too tired to properly listen to everyone and craft their\nresponses. After ward they usually need some downtime to recover from\ntheir interactions. Getting drained easily can interfere with your ability to practice, or just\nstay out with f riends as long as you\u2019d like. From an \u201cacce ptable, but\ninconvenient, dif ferences\u201d perspective, you may also be annoyed whenpeople d on\u2019 t un derstand you\u2019re wired this way; some less-sensitive people\nmay give you a hard time when you want to take of f from an event early , or\nthey may take it personally when you look tired around them. Short-term ways to feel less drained once the feeling has started to set in\nHave so me caffeine to give yourself a quick burst of energy . This\nsuggestion especially helps if you\u2019re out late and you\u2019re feeling\nsleepy on top of being depleted from socializing. Have a snack o r full meal if you haven\u2019t had any food in a w hile. Y our ener gy levels can subtly  slip if you\u2019ve gone hours without\neating. However , don\u2019 t eat so much that you go into a food coma. W ait until you get a second wind . T iredness tends to come in\nwaves, and your ener gy will usually rebound if you can gut out the\ngrogginess for twenty minutes or so. T ake mini-br eaks to r ecover some of your energy . Bathrooms are a\nclassic hideout. At a bigger func tion, moving from the hectic in doors\nto a more low-key conversation outside may be enough to give you a\nbreather . Consciously thr ow yourself into another gear and try to r e-\nengage with everyone. A fter you\u2019ve started feeling drained, it\u2019 s easy\nto gi ve i n to those feelings and sit back, zone out, and wait until you\ncan go home. Hanging back and doing nothing is dull and usually\nmakes y ou even  more tired and checked out. Instead, try to find a fun\ninteraction to join, which may perk you up and make you feel more\nenthusiastic. If you know a bout a draining event ahead of time, take a\nstrategic nap befor ehand so you\u2019ll have mor e energy . Becoming less susceptible to feeling drained over the long termE ven taki ng the above suggestion s into account, you can only do so much\nto hold back the drained feeling after it\u2019 s already started.

If you have mild to moderate sh yness or social anxiety , you sho uld be able\nto apply  the suggestions in t he next four chapters using a self-help\napproach.

Y ou\u2019ll still go through the sam e kinds of\ntreatment appro aches the following chapters cover , but a pro fessional or\nothers with similar issues can s upport you through the rough patches and\ncustomize everything to your needs. Also, go to a doctor to rule out whether\nyour anxiety has a physical cause, like an issue with your thyroid gland. Medication may  also be an option to look into. Speak to a physician or a\npsychiatrist abou t that possibility and to get the most up-to-date information\nabout your options. Medication dampens the physical symptoms of anxiety ,\nbut doesn\u2019 t af fect its underlying psychological causes. It needs to be used in\nconjunction with psychological treatment approaches that address those\nissues. Medicat ion can reduce your symptoms enough that you can\nimplement a treatment plan you\u2019d otherwise be too nervous to progress\nthrough. Although many people take me dication on a short-term basis, a smaller\nnumber feel it im proves their quality of life enough to justify staying on it\nlong-term. They realize that they were born with an overly high anxiety\nlevel, and medication brings it down to a level where they can functionbetter . Some people are justifiably wary about taking any kind of drug, and it\u2019 s\nnot a decision to be made lightly . Medication can cause side ef fects, and it\ncan take  people some time and e xperimentation before they find  a drug and\ndosage that works for them. In more severe cases, it can make the\ndif ference though, so at least give it some thought if a professional makes\nthat recommendation.5\nH a n d l i n g  C o u n t e r p r o d u c t i v e  T h i n k i n g  a b o u t\nS o c i a l i z i n g\nS HYNESS , SOCIAL  ANXIETY , INSECURITIES , AND  DISCOURAGEMENT  about your\nchances of improving are all sustained in part by thoughts and beliefs that\nare coun terproductive\u2014that is, thoughts that lead you away from good\noutcomes.

They can pop up  in the present moment or when you\u2019re looking  back on the\npast or toward t he future. If you can rein in your negative tho ughts about\nsocializing, you \u2019ll be more con tent and confident and have an  easier time\ngoing after what you want. This chapter explains the two broad ways your thinking can stifle you. Then it covers two approaches for dealing with your counterproductive\nthoughts. First, it gives you a fra mework for identifying and disputing these\ntypes of  though ts and replacing them with more-balanced alternatives. It\nthen exp lains an  equally ef fective alternative approach\u2014using mindfulness\nprinciples to acknowledge and accept your counterproductiv e thoughts\nwithout getting sucked into them.

These thought patte rns become\nmisleading and irrational in ways that sustain your problems. It\u2019 s possible to\nhave cog nitive d istortions about  all kinds of things, like your abi lity to grow\ntomatoes, but the examples below naturally focus on social situations. Emotional r easoning\nEmotional reaso ning is when you think that because your e motions are\ntelling y ou something is a certain way , it truly is  that way . For example,\nthinking that because you feel anxious, something must be happening that is\nworth feeling anxious about, when in fact maybe you\u2019re ju st on edge\nbecause you drank too much cof fee. In social situations, it often creates the\nreasoning of \u201cI\u2019m nervous about doing X, therefore X mus t be scary ,\ndif ficult, and complicated.\u201d\nJumping to conclusions\nWhen y ou jump to conclusions, you quickly assume something negative,\neven though your belief has little or no basis in reality . There are two\nvariations: mind reading and fortune-telling.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Having a broad  game plan\ncan help  becaus e it simplifies a nd clarifies what you have to think about,\ngives you the confidence that co mes from knowing you\u2019re using a method\nthat wor ks, and provides some reliable, simple starting material so you can\npractice. It\u2019 s good to have several approaches ready to go, and if one\ndoesn\u2019 t w ork, yo u can try anothe r . Y ou can also switch up broad approaches\nwithin a  single conversation as it evolves. Y ou don\u2019 t have to app ly only one\nstrategy to every person or situation. The broad conversation goals th at were covered earlier in the chapter are\none way  to give yourself some direction (\u201cI\u2019m going to ask about their\ninterests and try to find one we have in common,\u201d \u201cMy grandpa is\ninterested to know what I\u2019ve be en up to lately , so I\u2019ll focus on  telling him\nwhat\u2019 s b een new in my life since I last saw him\u201d). Here are some other\napproaches you can use:\nAppr oach #1: Be inter ested in and curious about other people, and\nmake it your goal to find out what\u2019 s fascinating and unique about them\nThis is the most popular general  approach you\u2019ll hear people me ntion when\nit comes to making conversation. It comes up again and again, going back\nto classic books on people skills like How to W in Fr iends and Influence\nPeople . Th e ide a is primarily to be som eone who asks questions and li stens\nto the answers, which leads to focusing the discussion on the other person. Y our \u201cmission\u201d in the convers ation is to discover what makes the other\nperson interesting. Y ou don\u2019 t need to only listen to  or talk about the other person the entire\ntime; yo u should bring up things about yourself and share  your own\nopinions when relevant. Generally focus the conversation on your partner ,\nbut not to the po int where you share nothing about yourself an d become afor gettable nonentity that just helps other people talk. The underlying assumption abou t this approach is that everyone\u2019 s favorite\nsubject is themselves, and that people like someone who take s a genuine\ninterest in them and the things they have to say . People also tend to feel\ngood ab out a conversation in which they can talk about aspects of\nthemselves that they\u2019re proud o f and passionate about. Another line you\u2019ll\noften he ar in regard to this strategy is that you\u2019ll be more succe ssful taking\nan in terest in other people than you will be by trying to get them interested\nin you. This approach predisposes you to adopt a positive, friendly frame of\nmind. It s basic premise implies that everyone is worth talking to if you dig\npast any preconceptions you ma y have of them. And because you\u2019re likely\nto find somethin g interesting about the other person if you look for it, it\nends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy . Appr oach #2: T alk in terms of the other person\u2019 s inter ests\nFocusing on the other person\u2019 s interests is similar to the approach above, in\nthat you\u2019re mainly listening and  the conversation is based around the other\nperson and things they like discussing. This approach is not exactly the\nsame. The approach above is more general and is about finding people\u2019 s\ngood traits, whatever they may be. This one is more about specifically\ntrying to find out what the other person is interested in talking about,\nwhether it\u2019 s a hobby or a life decision they\u2019re wrestling with, and centering\nthe con versation on that. Y ou take an interest in their interest, ask\nthoughtful questions, and listen as they tell you about it. The limitations of being an interested listenerBoth of these listening / other -person-centric approaches can work very\nwell and  are essential to have in your toolbox. At the same t ime, their\nef fectiveness is sometimes oversold.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>56147_CH16_324_340.indd   32956147_CH16_324_340.indd   329 10/1/08   11:14:44 AM10/1/08   11:14:44 AMChapter 16\n330hobby ( FIG.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

Second, humor can be expressed externally through an action in an effort to share it with others. It is accepted that everyone has a sense of humor, although from your personal experience, you may think you have proof to deny this statement. Among those who have studied humor, McGhee (1979) cites three factors that must be present for humor to exist:\n 1. Sources that act as potential stimuli (e.g., a pie \nthrown in someone\u2019s face)\n 2. A cognitive and intellectual activity involved with \nthe perception and evaluation of these sources (perceiving a faceful of whipped cream to be amusing)\n 3. Behavioral responses that are the expressions of \nhumor (i.e., smiling or laughing)\nTypes of Humor\nPerhaps the reason humor has been so dif\ufb01  cult to de\ufb01  ne \nis that there are so many shades of it that can be internal-ized or expressed. Furthermore, types of humor overlap and integrate with each other so that it is hard to separate them out sometimes. While there are several theories of how humor can be categorized, I list them here in a par-ticular order\u2014parody \ufb01  rst and sarcasm last\u2014according to their ef\ufb01  cacy at coping with stress. Everything between parody and sarcasm is fairly equal, and powerful in its own way, as either a subtle means to dissolve anger and fear, or to distract attention away from stress long enough for the body to return to homeostasis.

Parody is a work of humor that \nclosely imitates something, or someone,\n \nfor comical effect. Parody is typically a \nverbal or physical expression of humor bringing imperfections to light. This type of humor is considered to be one of the best, if not the best, types of humor to deal with stress, as long as it doesn\u2019t sac-ri\ufb01 ce self-esteem. Exaggera ting behav-\niors and personality traits are examples. Good-natured parody, however, should not be mistaken for self-criticism ex-pressed as an appeal for sympathy. When individuals can begin to parody and laugh at their own shortcomings, in their own minds, it will have the wonderful effect of reducing perceptions of stress. Celebrity \u201croasts\u201d are pro bably the best-known parodies. The Onion, a national college paper, and the television show The Of\ufb01  ce are also prime examples of \nparody. 2.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>These \u201ccontacts\u201d often prove stressful because of the nature of our com-municative interactions. Experts indicate that the aver-age person spends approximately three-quarters of his or her waking day communicating with others. Included under the rubric of communication are phone calls, emails, text messaging, blogging, lectures, staff meet-ings, dinner conversations, listening to radio and televi-sion, and simply talking with friends and acquaintances. The degree of perception and interpretation required for communication, and the many layers of meaning in even common words, leaves much room for misunder-standing\u2014and hence stress. This is why the practice of good communication skills is so important to help mini-mize and resolve misunderstandings. Good communi-cation skills are essential as a coping technique. To be a good communicator, one must not only express thoughts and feelings in understandable words, but also listen, clarify, and process information as it is intended. Communication skills are so important in the business world that workshops and seminars are given regularly on this topic; poor communication skills are simply not cost-effective. As you will see in this chapter, almost every theory and accompanying skill is based on com-mon sense. Yet common sense is often bound and gagged when the ego is threatened. When people are defensive, their ability to gather, process, and even exchange information becomes greatly impaired.

Dream therapy is a cognitive process that includes dream interpretation, dream incubation, and lucid dreaming. The purpose of dream therapy, which can be done either with the assistance of a therapist who spe-cializes in dream therapy or by yourself, is to access a greater share of consciousness through dream images and symbols to clarify and resolve personal issues (Foulkes, 1985; Flanagan, 2000). Dream interpretation involves three phases.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Unsent letters . Another topic common to journal \nwriters is called \u201cunsent letters.\u201d One type of res-olution people tend to avoid like the plague is rifts occurring in relationships of any kind. The hard-est rift to resolve occurs when a friend or loved one dies without your getting the chance to say goodbye. Kathleen Adams (1990) states that unsent letters provide the opportunity for \u201cthe three C\u2019s\u201d: catharsis, clarity, and completion. As a cathartic tool, the drafting of an unsent letter allows release of suppressed emotions including grief, anger, or guilt. For this journal technique to prove effective, it is a given that the letter does not go in the mail so that emotions can bubble up freely and surface without fear of self-censorship or reprisal. We all carry excess emotional baggage from unresolved relationships. The drafting of unsent letters allows us to lighten our emotional load. Clarity becomes evident when the writer realizes there is no chance for rebuttal from the addressee. Under this circumstance, you can be as direct as you wish and state exactly how you feel and why you feel this way. Although writing a \n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   23956147_CH10_229_243.indd   239 9/29/08   11:07:16 PM9/29/08   11:07:16 PMChapter 10\nletter to someone you need to communicate with \ndoes not resolve all issues, it does begin to bring \nthe unresolved issues to closure. A variation on this journal technique is to write down thoughts of anger and hostility and then crumple up the paper and throw it away. The crumpling adds to the emotional catharsis.

Most experts \nagree that humor is not itself a positive emotion, but that it can elicit positive emotions, including happiness, joy, love, faith, hope, and willpower. Humor is not a behavior, although it can produce actions (laughter and smiling) that are speci\ufb01  c to its nature. Humor is best described as a perception, for as we all know and have experienced, what one person \ufb01  nds funny someone else does not. The following are two de\ufb01  nitions to illustrate this elusive perception (McGhee, 1979):\n 1. Humor is \u201cthe mental experience of discovering \nand appreciating ludicrous or absurd ideas, events, or situations that bring pleasure or enjoy-ment to the individual.\u201d\n 2. Humor is \u201cthe quality of being funny or appreci-\nating funny thoughts or acts of behavior; the abil-ity to perceive/enjoy what is funny or comical, a state of mind, feeling, or mood.\u201d\nIt appears from the de\ufb01  nitions that humor has two fun-\ndamental aspects.

Sometimes\nthey\u2019re just as rewarding if they stay at a light-hearted, superficial level. This chapter covers various ways conversations can feel \u201cdeeper\u201d\u2014by\nmoving past small talk, connecting, opening up to each other , and\ndiscussing more intellectual top ics. When you are able to comfortably have\ndeeper , more intimate conversations, your interactions with people can\nbecome even more rewarding. M o v i n g  p a s t  s m a l l  t a l k\nWhen yo u\u2019re first talking to som eone, you\u2019ll often cover general, well-worn\ntopics like your career and education. Asking and answering common\nquestions sometimes has a rote, uninspired feeling to it. This is one type of\nthe dreaded small talk that many  people say they dislike. In a perfect world,\nwe\u2019d never have to do it, but small talk serves some purposes:\nRoutine questio ns are a reliable way to get a conversation going.They let each pe rson cast around for a subject that\u2019 s more eng aging\nfor both  of them. A few lines of  questioning may be repetitive and go\nnowhere, but the next one might be interesting. Standard chitchat helps ease your nerves when you\u2019re most likely to\nfeel anxious. It gives you some safe, predictable, low-mental-ener gy\ntopics to draw on. Small ta lk gives you a platform to show what kind of person you are,\naside from the things you like to discuss. As you spend a few minutes\ncovering familiar ground with someone, you can demonstrate that\nyou\u2019re warm, confident, and glad to talk to them. Many pe ople expect to start a conversation with some neutral small\ntalk, so if you try too hard to barrel past it, you may seem like you\nlack social savvy . Whether a conversation feels lik e small talk also depends on its context. If\nyou\u2019re i nterested in getting to know someone, you usually won\u2019 t have a\nproblem telling them about wha t you do for work or where you grew up. However , if you\u2019re sure the relationship is never going to go any where, like\nif you\u2019re talking to a stranger in  line at the bank, then the same topics can\nfeel forced and like you\u2019re pointlessly going through the motions. Y ou\u2019ll\nalso tend to lose  patience with any topic that comes up over an d over in a\nshort tim e (for example, being asked what you\u2019re taking in college during a\nfamily reunion). T alking about unexciting, trivial topics\nThe term  \u201csmall talk\u201d also refe rs to conversations about mundane, trivial\ntopics like the weather , often with someone you already kn ow , at least\ncasually . Many people aren\u2019 t enthusiastic about this either and wish they\ncould go into deeper , more meaningful subjects. This type of small talk alsohas some justifications:\nIt allows you to socialize with people for its own sake, show your\ninterest in them, and maintain your relationship. Often it lets you  exchange pleasantries in situations where you don\u2019 t\nhave time to ha ve a more intense conversation or the environ ment\nisn\u2019 t con ducive to it. If you run into a coworker in the parking lot,\nyou wan t to acknowledge them and show you\u2019re friendly , but you\nmay hav e only a minute before you have to head home. Some quick\ntalk about the local news is better than nothing. It can keep relationships primed for more substantial socializing\ndown th e road.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>First, only a handful of people (3 percent) wrote every day in their journals, and while more women than men kept jour-nals, the difference was not signi\ufb01  cant. Second, journal \nentries were centered less on emotions than on facts to describe speci\ufb01  c events, a style that may not have been as bene\ufb01  cial an experience as perceived by the journal \nwriter. Last, he found that journal writers seemed to fall into two distinct categories. The \ufb01  rst group tended to \nwrite only during periods of mental frustration and monumental stress. The journal became a sounding board and tended to carry the burden of anxieties. The second group wrote nearly every day; however, when a major stressor arose (e.g., death of a spouse, career stress), a time when writing might be the most help, a safe dis-tance was kept from the journal and no writing took place. Pennebaker noted a third group of people, though, who instead of keeping a journal, wrote letters. Although this may seem similar to journal entries, letters are often less than candid about internal feelings about oneself to oneself. In my work with clients, I have also noticed a fourth group: people who do not necessarily write fre-quently, perhaps once or twice a week, but whose jour-nal entries tend to be balanced between positive and negative experiences.

This chapter covers how to do that. It goes over the three main ways\nto m ake a group of friends: 1) mer ging your individual friends i nto a group;\n2) m aking one friend and then falling in with their social circle; and 3)\nmaking a new group of friends all at once. The second and third methods\ninvolve joining an existing grou p, so the second half of the ch apter gives\nsome pointers on how to do that. Once m ore, kee p in mind the social world is unpredictable, an d over the\nshort ter m, you \u2019ll only have so much power to create the exact type of\nfriend circle you want. Even if you set out to become part of a group, it may\nnot happ en righ t away . Here are more details on the three way s to make a\ngroup of friends:\nM e r g e  y o u r  i n d i v i d u a l  f r i e n d s  i n t o  a  g r o u p\nIf y ou have se veral individual  friends, how can you get them to start\nhanging out with each other? First, you\u2019ll need to arrange some way for\nthem to meet. Y ou could try intr oducing them to each other one or two at a\ntime, perhaps by seeing a movie  or going out to eat together , o r you could\nor ganize a bigger get-together a nd have them all meet at once. However ,\nthere\u2019 s n o foolproof way to ensure your individual friends wi ll like each\nother . Everyone hangs out with a variety of people, and they\u2019re not always\ncompatible with each other , even though they all share the commonality ofgetting along with you. Y ou just have to put them together and see if it\nworks out. One basic tip is to mention things they have in common to bre ak the ice\nbetween your friends to get them  talking (\u201cBob, David used to work at the\nsame no nprofit y ou did\u201d). If you \u2019re introducing one friend to a small group,\ndon\u2019 t leave them to fend for themselves. T o allow for the bes t chance of\nyour frie nds clicking, try to hang out with everyone on several occasions. People o ften don \u2019 t have enough time to really learn much about each other\nduring one meeting. Spending t ime with each other over mult iple outings\nalso get s everyo ne thinking along the lines of, \u201cW e\u2019re a group that often\nhangs out together .\u201d\nM a k e  o n e  f r i e n d ,  m e e t  t h e i r  b u d d i e s ,  a n d  t r y  t o  f a l l  i n\nw i t h  t h a t  g r o u p\nIf you\u2019ve made an individual friend or two already , you can try to meet their\nfriends and see if you can joi n that social circle. If you hang out with\nsomeone enough, these opportunities will likely come up naturally . If not,\nyou can take the  initiative to m eet your friend\u2019 s friends. If you catch wind\nthat they do an y kind of group activity regularly , you can ask to come\nalong. Y ou could also try to meet them by planning some sort of party or\nlar ger get-together . Here it\u2019 s also a good play to try to meet your friend\u2019 s\nfriends more than once so they have more time to get to know you and get\nadjusted to the idea of having you around. M a k e  a  g r o u p  o f  n e w  f r i e n d s  a l l  a t  o n c e\nThere are two ways you can do this. The first is when you join a pre-\nexisting social circle at a class, job, or club. For example, you start\nvolunteering at an animal shelter and quickly fall in with a group of fellowvolunteers you see often. The second is when outside circumstances force\nyou and several other people, w ho don\u2019 t know each other either , to spend a\nlot of time together (for examp le, you all moved into the same floor of a\ndorm, or you\u2019ve all started a job at the same time). When you\u2019re in these situations, try to or ganize a get-together that brings\neveryone together outside of the context where you\u2019ve all met. If you want\nto make a grou p of friends in  a work, school, or club setting, it\u2019 s also\nimportant to be friendly with many of the people and existing groups there. Y ou can hardly create a lar ger circle at your job if you only talk to two\ncoworkers.

They interact with the group at l east somewhat regularly , but still feel\nlike an occasional guest; they\u2019d prefer to be a full-fledged member . Just like you ca n\u2019 t form a grou p of friends to order , there\u2019 s no way to\nguarantee you can join any spe cific group. This subsection covers how to\njoin groups that you have some things in common with and who are open to\nhaving y ou, not how to sneak  into that one super -snobby clique. Some\ngroups are just going to be di f ficult to join because the me mbers have\nknown each other a while an d are reluctant to include new  members. Whatever the group you\u2019re trying to get in with, try not to put them on apedestal. They\u2019r e just a social circle, not gods with the power t o determine\nyour ha ppiness. If you don\u2019 t become closer with them, it may be\ndisappointing, but there are always other prospects. Depending on your particular s ituation and the group you want to join,\nyou may not need to use every one of the following steps:\nStep 1: Make initial contact\nThis step may be  taken care of automatically if you\u2019ve been introduced by a\nfriend or your c ircumstances.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Not all of his patients had this exceptional ability, and their draw ings often foreshadowed immi-nent death. In the spirit of Jung, Siegel soon came upon the realization that messages from the unconscious mind manifest in symbolic images and characteristics. These images accentuate the patient\u2019s fears, anger, lev-els of self-esteem, grief, guilt, and the intensity of the personal problems and con\ufb02  icts that ultimately pave the path to disease. In one illustration, a patient drew her-self at the extreme right-hand, bottom corner of the page, leaving the rest of the paper blank. This was inter-preted to suggest low self-esteem, which was later con-\ufb01 rmed by the artist. In a similar episode, a young boy \ndrew only the top half of his body over the entire page, leaving the physician curious and frightened. The young boy then turned the page over to reveal the bot-tom half, hinting that recovery was well on its way\u2014and putting a huge smile on Siegel\u2019s face. Although there are exceptions, there is a consensus \namong art therapists that regardless of gender, nation-ality, or ethnic upbringing, each color in art therapy represents an archetypal meaning. Typically, the color selection as well as the objects drawn (e.g., house, tree) parallel emotional expressions of one\u2019s mental health. The following list suggests associations between colors and their archetypal meanings:\nRed: passionate emotional peaks (from pleasure to \npain); can represent either compassion or anger\nOrange: life change (big or small)Yellow: energy (usually a positive message)Blue and green: happiness and joy (blue may even \nmean creativity)\nPurple/violet: highly spiritual nature; unconditional \nlove\nBrown (and earth-tone colors): a sense of grounded-\nness and stability\nBlack: (1) grief, despair, or fear or (2) a sense of per-\nsonal empowerment\nWhite: (1) fear, avoidance, or coverup or (2) hopeGray: ambiguity or uncertainty\nNot all professionals agree on the association between \ncolor selection and its interpretation; art therapist Rebecca Crane offers a slightly different explanation. In her professional experience, yellow and orange signify  Expressive Art Therapy\n249pleasantness or happiness. Violet and red convey unhap-piness. Speci\ufb01  cally, violet represents grief or death, while red is used to express anger, frustration, and annoyance. Although cancer patients have received the most public-\nity from their use of art therapy as a coping technique, art therapists have also used this tool in the awareness and recovery process of other stress-related problems, including migraine headaches (\nFIG. 11.5  /H17073), gastro-\nintestinal problems, anorexia, and post-traumatic stress disorders of patients surviving the atrocities of war.

It\u2019 s great to\nsteer clear of as many bad habits as possible, but don\u2019 t put too much strain\non yourself to be  flawless when you talk to people. No one gets it right 100\npercent of the ti me. Also, even if you converse in a way that most people\nfind acceptable, you\u2019ll encounte r the occasional person who ha s a dif ferent\nperspective and sees something  as a mistake on your part (for example,\nsomeone who\u2019 s overly sensitive may take of fense to normal af fectionate\nteasing). Don\u2019 t let a fear of making a mistake paralyze you. Many so-called\nmistakes aren\u2019 t ideal, but they\u2019 re not that  bad , and the conversation will\noften co ntinue ju st fine. For example, it\u2019 s not great to brag, but if you subtly\ntalk yourself up one time, most people aren\u2019 t instantly going to be turned\nof f. They may n ot even see it as bragging to begin with, just y ou stating a\nfact about yourself.If you\u2019r e just getting the hang of making conversation and are anxious\nabout getting rejected or making a bad impression, you can get so worried\nabout all  the behaviors you have  to avoid that your mind goes bl ank. Saying\nsomething less- than-perfect is often better than saying nothin g at all. At\nleast that way you\u2019re keeping the conversation going and giving the other\nperson s omething to react to. F or example, if you mildly brag  about how\ngood you are a t drawing, the other person may start talking about how\nthey\u2019re into art as well. If you catch yourself making a bigger mistake, you can usually smooth it\nover by apologizing for it. Don\u2019 t say you\u2019re sorry in too serious a tone. Just\nquickly , casually  acknowledge what you did wrong, then get on with the\ndiscussion. For example, \u201cWhoops, I just cut you of f. Sorry about that.

As Chapter\n14 e xplained, it\u2019 s acceptable in loud, rowdy group conversations for\npeople to interrupt and talk ove r each other as they try to make  their\npoints heard. Some \u201cbad\u201d behaviors ar e accepted in particular subcultur es or\nsocial gr oups. I n a gro up of young, bro-ish guys, mild bragging may\nbe comm on and acceptable. A circle of intellectual friends may be\nfine with members correcting each other .Individuals vary in which social mistakes bother them. Someone\nwho\u2019 s n ot a big talker themse lves may have fewer issues with a\nmonopolizer . So meone with a crasser sense of humor may not mind a\nless-sensitive friend. Our friendships are partially determined by\nwhat mistakes we don\u2019 t mind, or even find endearing, in others.

Slowly work up to sharing bigger pieces of yourself with people who are\nmore important  to you. Y ou don\u2019 t want to become an open book to\neveryone on the planet; you just  want to be able to self-disclose to the same\ndegree most people can.

Y ou could try a rranging a get-together yourself (see Chapter 26).Even if everyon e can\u2019 t make i t, your invitation sends the message\nthat you\u2019re interested in hanging out with them. For this suggestion,\nyou have to use your judgment about whether planning something for\nthe grou p would be appropriate. Some groups are fine with newer\nmembers trying to make plans. O thers are more established and set in\ntheir wa ys and will tune out ide as from anyone they don\u2019 t know  well\nenough. If you got into the gr oup thr ough one or two people, get connected to the\nother members\nAnother problem people have when joining a group is they\u2019ll start hanging\nout w ith a group regularly , but even if everyone is nice to them, it\u2019 s still like\nthey\u2019re perpetua l guests of the friend or friends who initially  introduced\nthem. A side from  spending more time with the group, here are some ways\nto move beyond that situation:\nWhen you\u2019re all hanging out, take time to break away from  your\noriginal friend(s ) and get to know the other members. Make it clear\nyou want to ge t to know every one better and not just accom pany\nyour buddy to the odd get-together . Get the other gr oup members\u2019 contact info. Aside from allowing you\nto get in touch with them and se nding another signal that you want to\nget to know the whole group, it also frees you from having to rely on\nyour original connection as yo ur sole means of hearing abou t the\ngroup\u2019 s plans. Y ou don \u2019 t have to become equally close to everyone or have the m all like\nyou to the same degree. Althoug h you want to get away from b eing seen as\nthe g uest of one  or two membe rs, you don\u2019 t have to become best friendswith every last person in the group. As long as a group on the whole wants\nyou around, it\u2019 s okay if your connection with a few member s is a little\nundeveloped. In most social circles, even though everyone gets along, some\nmembers are closer than others. If the group is big enough, th ere will be\nsubgroups withi n the lar ger one. When you\u2019re new to a group, try to be on\nfairly go od term s with everyone, but also look for the handful of members\nyou get along with best. As long as one of the subgroups ta kes you in,\nyou\u2019ll be seen as part of the bigger crowd. Step 3: Put in your time with the gr oup and deepen your r elationship\nwith everyone\nAfter yo u\u2019re hanging out with the group consistently , becoming more\nenmeshed in it i s mostly a matt er of time. If you put in enough  hours with\nthem, th ey\u2019ll nat urally start to think of you as a member . Y ou\u2019ll get to know\neveryone better , even if it\u2019 s onl y a group that gets together to party , rather\nthan have lots of intimate di scussions. Y ou\u2019ll share some memorable\nexperiences. Y ou\u2019ll become familiar with their private jokes and get in on\nthe grou nd floo r for new ones  that develop. Mostly this will  all happen\nautomatically , but you can speed the process along by consciously adapting\nand applying the ideas in the previous chapter on growing relationships. Understand that you may not feel like a full-fledged member for a\nwhile\nSometimes whe n you join a group, you\u2019ll feel like a full-on m ember right\naway . Alternatively , you might feel like a hanger -on for a few months. That\ndoesn\u2019 t n ecessarily mean the group doesn\u2019 t like you; if some members have\nknown e ach oth er for years and  years, they\u2019ll be more drawn toward each\nother and might unintentionally leave you out. Once you\u2019re hanging out\nwith the group on a regular b asis, you\u2019re in. Don\u2019 t discount that andconvince yourself you\u2019re still an outsider . Just keep showing u p and doing\nwhat yo u\u2019re doing; over time you\u2019ll get to know everyone better and\nbecome more of a core member . Accept that becoming part of a gr oup doesn\u2019t always work out\nExposure and familiarity genera lly increase bonds between people, but it\u2019 s\nnot guar anteed. Sometimes you \u2019ll join a group, feel on thin ic e the whole\ntime, and then eventually leave when you realize you\u2019ll nev er be fully\nincluded. Y ou need to be willing to go through this uncertain, r isky period. Any fee lings of being a second-tier member may only be temporary . If you\nreally fe el yours elf struggling, it may be a sign the group isn\u2019 t a good match\nfor you.29\nM a k i n g  F r i e n d s  i n  P a r t i c u l a r  S i t u a t i o n s\nU P  T O  THIS  POINT ,  th is section ha s covered a gen eral structure for how to\nmake fri ends. Here are some ad ditional suggestions for two situations that\npeople c ommonly have trouble with: making friends in college, and making\nfriends as an adult, after university , or when you\u2019re in a new city . M a k i n g  f r i e n d s  i n  c o l l e g e\nThe college environment is one of the easiest places to make friends. Y ou\u2019re\nsurrounded by thousands of pe ers, most of whom are open to meeting\npeople. Of course, that statement can seem like a slap in the face if you\u2019re at\nuniversity and struggling with your social life. Students have two main\nproblems with making friends in college:\nThey fel l into their friendships in high school and don\u2019 t know h ow to\ndeliberately make new ones. They fee l like everyone ef fortlessly made friends during the first few\nweeks o f school , but they didn\u2019 t, and they don\u2019 t know how to form a\nsocial circle after missing that window . Making friends  during day-to-day college life is mostly a matter of\nfollowing the concepts laid out in the previous chapters. Meet people in\nyour classes, at your dorm, thro ugh clubs and student associations, and at\nany part-time jobs you may have. T ake the initiative to inv ite possible\nfriends out, then try to continue to see them so the relationship c an develop.Of course, if you have problems with shyness or making conversation, you\nneed to put some time into tackling those issues too. Suggestions for making friends during your first few weeks of college\nWhen you begin university , you aren\u2019 t the only person who doesn\u2019 t know\nanyone. Most of the other students have left their friends and family behind\ntoo, and  need to make new friends. Here\u2019 s how to more easily m eet and get\nto know them:\nRealize pretty much everyone  feels a little nervous, unsure of\nthemselves, and overwhelmed when starting college. Most people are\njust putting on a brave face  because they mistakenly assume\neveryone else has their act together . Get to know som e people before the school year starts. If you go to\nan information session in the months leading up to the first sem ester ,\nget p eople\u2019 s contact info and keep in touch with them. If your major\nhas a group on a  social network, reach out to some of your soo n-to-\nbe c lassmates through it. If you\u2019re in town a few days before school\nstarts, arrange to meet up with anyone who\u2019 s also around. If it\u2019 s feasible, try to get famili ar with the campus and surrounding\narea ahead of tim e. Y ou\u2019ll feel more comfortable once school s tarts,\nand you \u2019ll be able to start a few conversations by of fering to help\nother students find their way around. If it\u2019 s a realistic option for yo u and you really want to get some\npractice with the university experience, go backpacking in another\ncountry beforeh and and stay in  hostels. The hostel life is similar to\nliving in a dorm, both practically and socially . Go t o as many Orientation W eek  events as you can. Y ou\u2019ll meet a lot\nof peop le, especially ones from your faculty . The rowdy , p arty-centric atmosph ere of the first week isn\u2019 t for everyone, but there\nshould be some non\u2013drinking-related events. If you\u2019re not into\npartying, you won\u2019 t be the only one, and you can seek out other\nstudents who are on the same page. If you live in a residence hall, g et to know the people on your floor . Go door to doo r and introduce yourself, or hang around the lo unge\nand talk  to whoever comes in. Drop in to visit your neighbors o n the\nfloors above and below you too. If you live at ho me or of f-campus, hang around school as mu ch as\nyou can . Y ou can\u2019 t meet new p eople if you\u2019re always holed up in\nyour own place. Chat to whoeve r you want to. The first few weeks are a social free-\nfor -all, a nd no one is going to look sideways at someone who\u2019 s being\noutgoing and trying to meet people. Realize it\u2019 s okay to tag along with groups of people or to go to\nOrientation W eek events alone. The group you\u2019re going with\nprobably just met a few days ag o, so it\u2019 s not like you\u2019re intruding on\ntheir clique. If you head to an event alone, you can start\nconversations w ith whomever you want because the whole point of\nthem is for people to mingle. One or two of yo ur fellow students may be vague acquaintances from\nyour high school.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>If you met someone\nyou had nothing in common with, maybe you could have a long interaction\nif you faked an interest in their hobbies and told them exactly  what they\nwanted to hear about everything. But after the exchange wa s over you\nmight look back and realize you go nothing out of it.

In the longer term, the best way to get used to the\nthings th at make  you nervous is  to expose yourself to them gradually . The\nnext chapter goes into detail about this.7\nR e d u c i n g  F e a r s  a n d  I n s e c u r i t i e s  t h r o u g h\nR e a l - W o r l d  E x p e r i e n c e s\nT HE  IDEA S  IN  THE  PREVIOUS  CHAPT ERS  certainly help reduce counterproductive\nthinking. Howev er , some beliefs are hardier and will start to fad e only when\nthey\u2019ve been overwritten by contradictory real-world experiences. Sometimes you \u2019ll have a fea r or belief that you logicall y know is\ninaccurate, but it still feels  true and limits your behavior . In these  cases, analyzing and de bunking your thoughts isn\u2019 t enough. For\none, your mind won\u2019 t give much weight to the conclusions you come to. It\nresponds much more strongly to  real-life evidence, and wrong o r not, as far\nas your mind is concerned, it has past experiences that show t he belief is\nreasonable. Y ou  may feel like you\u2019ve successfully disarmed a belief, but it\nwill often return. The other problem is that when you have a fear or\ninsecurity , it can generate a nea rly endless supply of worried thoughts. If\nyou deb unk some of them, new ones will just take their place (for example,\nif you\u2019re  scared to talk to people at parties and defuse your w orries about\nbeing made fun of, you may de velop new ones about accidentally making\nsomeone angry). The bul k of this chapter covers how to get used to the social situations\nthat make you nervous. But first, it explains how real-world experiences can\naf fect yo ur mind-set about socializing and reduce insecurities and limiting\nbeliefs that don\u2019 t necessarily have a big anxiety component to them. K n o w i n g  w h y  y o u  m u s t  g a i n  f i r s t h a n d  e x p e r i e n c e sReal-life feedba ck can overwrite unhelpful beliefs, but the process is\ngradual. Say you have the belief, \u201cI\u2019m boring and people don\u2019 t enjoy my\ncompany .\u201d As you begin to polish your social skills, people will begin to\nshow you that th ey like having you around. The first few times it happens,\nyou\u2019ll probably  dismiss it as a fluke. As it keeps happening, you\u2019ll\ntentatively start to accept that some people do like your company; you may\nadopt some more self-assured behaviors, but you\u2019ll lar gely remain\nskeptical. W ith enough time, the way you see yourself will stop lagging\nbehind your actual progress, an d you\u2019ll be able to see yourself in a more\npositive light. Some traces of the original insecurity may always remain, but\nshould be easy enough to act against. The pro cess is the same for us eful attitudes like \u201cDon\u2019 t care too much\nabout what other people think.\u201d Again, you can\u2019 t instantly take on that\nmentality becau se you\u2019ve read it\u2019 s good to have. On a deepe r level, you\nmay fea r other people\u2019 s opinion of you. However , over many small\noccasions, you can choose to do  things you want to do, but may  draw some\nnegative respon ses (for example, speaking up with a less-pop ular belief,\nwearing unconv entional clothes ). As you continually experience firsthand\nthat acting that way has benefits and that you can handle the consequences,\nit slo wly reinforces the importan ce of not being overly concerned with what\nother people think of you. (\u201cWhen I made that edgy joke, one or two people\nmade m ildly uncomfortable fa ces, but it wasn\u2019 t so bad. Everyone else\nthought it was really funny . And  it just felt good not to hold back my sense\nof humor like I always used to.\u201d)\nA common piece of social advic e in this vein is to \u201cFake it \u2019 til you make\nit.\u201d That is, force yourself to act outwardly confident even though you don\u2019 t\nfeel that sure of yourself deep down; then let the positive reinforcement that\ncomes from your self-assured behavior build true confidence. This\nsuggestion has limits. Y ou may feel comfortable outwardly faking someconfident behaviors, but others will be too nerve-racking and too much of a\nleap from how you normally a ct. If you\u2019re really insecure, a nxious, and\nsocially inexperienced, you can\u2019 t slip on the persona of someone who\u2019 s\nhighly confident  just like that. However , you may be able to pul l of f smaller\ntasks, like introducing yourself t o someone at your job when you otherwise\nwould have taken a pass. T h e  i m p o r t a n c e  o f  f a c i n g  y o u r  f e a r s\nIf a soci al situation really makes  you nervous, you need to put y ourself in it\nuntil you  get comfortable with it. Y ou may never be completely unfazed by\nthe situation, but you can get to a point where your fear is low enough that\nit doesn\u2019 t keep you from going after what you want. Exposing yours elf to a fear works because it overwrites yo ur mind\u2019 s\nassociation of Situation \u2013 >  Cue to get nervous . Ho wever , to d o that, you\nneed to be aro und your fear long enough that you calm down and\nexperience firsthand you\u2019ll be okay . If you briefly put yoursel f in contact\nwith som ething scary , then bolt while you\u2019re still feeling nervous, your\nbrain hasn\u2019 t learned anything new . When it comes to situations t hat make you only mildly un easy , just\nknowing this may be enough to get you to start changing your b ehavior . For\nexample, invitin g people to han g out may make you mildly anxious to the\npoint that if you live on autopilot, you\u2019ll default to not extending invitations\nto anyon e. Once  you\u2019re aware it\u2019 s important to of fer invites, it may be easy\nenough for you to take a deep breath and go through with it. If you have a fear that\u2019 s more in tense, you need to be more strategic about\nfacing it . Psycho logists have found the most ef fective way to face a fear is\nto gradu ally expose yourself to it; this is called exposur e therapy . Y ou start\nwith a milder variation of your fear , face that until you\u2019re comf ortable with\nit, and then wor k your way up to more nerve-racking scenarios.

Incongruity (Surprise) Theory\nOn Saturday Night Live, parodies of commercials are \npart of the format and sometimes only seasoned veter-ans can distinguish the real ads from the fake ones. In one car commercial, to demonstrate how smoothly the car rode over roads \ufb01  lled with potholes from hell, in the back seat a circumcision was performed on a crying new born. To the delight (and relief) of the parents, the operation was a success. Incongruity theory  concerns two unrelated thoughts \njoined for a surprisingly comic effect (Box 12.2). Humor \narises because the mind just doesn\u2019t expect the outcome. As eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant once said, \u201cLaughter is the af\ufb02  iction arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing\u201d (Robinson, 1991). Ziv (1984) maintains that a surprise in the processing of \ninformation can best be described as incongruous, the juxtaposition of two strikingly different concepts (e.g., a Chinese mariachi player). Oxymorons fall into this cat-egory. Humor and creativity are lifetime partners in incongruity theory. Koestler (1964) described this cre-ative thought process as bisociation, the catalyst of \nhumor, especially incongruous humor. There are said to be two types of incongruity: ascend-\ning, or \u201cah ha,\u201d which produces wonder and awe, and descending, or \u201cha ha,\u201d which produces humor.

This cha pter describes the four main confidence and comfort issues that\ninterfere with people\u2019 s ability to socialize:\n1 . Shyness\n2 . Social anxiety\n3 . Insecurity\n4 . Pessimism and discouragement\nS h y n e s s\nShyness is a mu ltifaceted condition with many variations and nuances, but\nin sh ort it\u2019 s when you feel inhibited and uncomfortable in ce rtain social\nsituations becau se you\u2019re worried about how you\u2019ll come across to\neveryone. Just as other social dif ficulties can range from mil d to severe,\nshyness also comes in degrees. If you\u2019re slightly shy , you may seem totally\nfunctional and even charming. Even though you may have some inner\nworries and insecurities, you can socialize in spite of them. Y our shyness\nisn\u2019 t a huge problem, but even if  you\u2019re performing well outwardly , it\u2019 s stilldraining to be constantly worrying and doubting yourself . If you\u2019re\nmoderately shy ,  you\u2019ll be more hesitant and quiet than normal in social\nsituations, but still be able to get by . If you\u2019re severely shy , you\u2019 ll be totally\nwithdrawn, if you get into many interactions at all. Less mild forms of\nshyness overlap with social anxiety , which will be covered in a second. The richest aspect of shyness is the thinking patterns and beliefs that fuel\nit.

On the downsid e, if you\u2019re go ing to have trouble in a conversation, it\u2019 s\nlikely go ing to be in those first c ouple of minutes. There are two  reasons for\nthis: First, if som eone doesn\u2019 t feel like speaking to you or you don\u2019 t have\nmuch to say to each other , that\u2019 s going to become clear quickly . The other\nperson w on\u2019 t give you much to  work with, or you\u2019ll both struggle to find\nsomething to talk about. Rem ember , there\u2019 s no way to en sure every\ninteraction you have will go w ell. Second, you\u2019re usually feeling at your\nmost ne rvous an d on the spot when you\u2019re first talking to someone, and\nanxiety can cause you or your c onversation partner to stall. If you can get\npast that point, the rest of the conversation is usually easier . It\u2019 s grea t when you find an interesting subject to talk about right away , but\nit\u2019 s not at all unusual for a conv ersation to be a little stilted in its opening\nminutes. That\u2019 s no reason to panic. This awkwardness isn\u2019 t a sign that the\ninteraction won\u2019 t be enjoyable o r that you have horrible people skills. It justmeans that each person hasn\u2019 t found their footing yet. In a few minutes,\neveryone may be feeling more comfortable and have found something fun\nto talk about. Sometimes a conversation you start may peter out soon after it begins. Knowing this takes some of the pressure away . Every time you talk to\nsomeone, realiz e that they may be preoccupied, have nothing in common\nwith you, or be  too shy to think of anything to say . Also accept that\nsometimes you just won\u2019 t be on your game and able to do your part to keep\nthe conv ersation moving. Have a plan for gracefully leaving a conversation\nthat isn\u2019 t going anywhere. Rather than panicking and blaming yourself,\nkeep your cool and move on. (Chapter 13 covers how to end conversations.)\nG e n e r a l  g u i d e l i n e s  f o r  s t a r t i n g  c o n v e r s a t i o n s\nThe app ropriate ways to initiate a conversation vary depending on the\nsituation you\u2019re  in. If you\u2019re at a friend\u2019 s party , it\u2019 s expected that people\nwill talk to each other , and most of the guests are there to do just that. It\u2019 s\nfine to start con versations in a more forward, familiar , casual  way where\nyou act as if yo u\u2019re already on good terms with everyone. In m ore formal\nsettings, like a career networking event, you should be a little more reserved\nand mannered. Still be friendly , but don\u2019 t be overly casual or chummy right\nof f the bat. T alking to strangers in public pl aces during the day is on the ot her end of\nthe s pectrum. Some people are open to talking, but others are going about\ntheir day  and have other priorities. Read their body language for clues about\nhow open they may be to interacting with you (see Chapter 18). If they\nseem really preoccupied and c losed of f, it may be better to leave them\nalone. Y ou need  to respect that they may initially be wary and not know\nwhat you want from them or not be in the mood to talk. Y ou may need to\nget their attention with a smile or an \u201cexcuse me\u201d first. Still be friendly , butspeak w ith them  in a more pulled-back, noncommittal way to gi ve them the\nsense that you\u2019ll back of f if they don\u2019 t want to chat. Know your city and country\u2019 s at titude about what\u2019 s considered acceptable\ntoo. In some areas, people are constantly , cheerfully talking to each other in\ngrocery store lines, while in other places, the culture is \u201cDon\u2019 t intrude on\nanyone\u2019 s space. \u201d If your culture is less talkative, it doesn\u2019 t mean you\u2019ll\nnever be  able to speak to anyone you don\u2019 t know . If you try , yo u just need\nto be extra respectful and realize you won\u2019 t always get a warm response. Public places where people go specifically to socialize, like nightclubs,\nfall in between. Y ou have implicit permission to try to strike up a\nconversation with people you don\u2019 t know , and you can ofte n be more\ncasual; h owever , you also have to respect that not everyone goes to those\nplaces looking to chat with a b unch of strangers. If they don\u2019 t seem like\nthey want to talk and would rather stick with the friends they  came with,\nthen move on.

In the year 1260, a pro-gressive French physician, Henri de Moundeville, saw the important relationship between positive emotions and sound health, and made a practice of allowing fam-ily and friends to cheer and joke with their sick rela-tives. He wrote, \u201cLet the surgeon take care to regulate the whole regimen of the patient\u2019s life for joy and hap-piness.\u201d European monarchs also saw the importance of laughter, and often employed court jesters (those guys with funny shoes) to add mirth to their castle courts. Perhaps the most renowned court jester was Richard Tarlton, who was credited with keeping British Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603) in better health than did her team of physicians. But laughter has not always been looked upon with \nfavor. Europeans in the Middle Ages and Puritans on the eastern shores of North America, among others, perceived laughter to be the work of the devil. People caught laughing out loud were often denounced as witches or believed to be possessed by Satan. The expres-sion of humor was considered a sin in many Christian denominations. Other comments from those days about laughter (Moody, 1978):\nLaughter on any occasion is immoral and indecent. Laughter obscures truth, hardens the heart, and stu-pe\ufb01 es understanding. A man of parts of fashion is therefore only seen to smile, but never heard to laugh. \u2014Lord Chester\ufb01  eld, 1748\nAnd if you look at the portraits of European nobility \ncommissioned over a period of several hundred years, you are hard-pressed to \ufb01  nd anyone smiling (except perhaps the Mona Lisa). The words \u201csay cheese\u201d were not coined for use with the \n\ufb01 rst camera in the nineteenth century, either; people were \nafraid of being caught sinning in public (\nFIG. 12.1  /H17076).</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

Describing feelings differs from expressing feelings, in \nthat description involves the use of words, whereas expression may include physical responses such as cry-ing, laughing, touching, or some other physical action. Although there are many ways to express emotions, verbal communication is deemed essential when they involve other people.

Be c omfortable letting people  know you like them. G et used totelling n ew friends you find th em interesting to talk to or letting\nyourself show a warm smile when you see them. Be comfortable  with self-disclosur e. People often connect over\naspects of themselves that they don\u2019 t share with just anyone. It is\npossible to connect over a safer  topic, like having the same favorite\nband, but you\u2019ll give yourself more opportunities to find a connection\nif ce rtain subjects aren\u2019 t of f lim its. The next section has advice on\nhow and when to self-disclose appropriately . F i n d i n g  V a l u e  i n  S e l f - D i s c l o s u r e\nOne significant way to take a conversation to deeper territory is to exchange\ninformation that\u2019 s more personal. As two people get to know  each other ,\nthey\u2019ll s top talking only about safe, superficial topics and slowly start\nsharing more of their vulnerabilities, blemishes, and \u201ctrue selves.\u201d\nSafe, su rface-level topics inclu de  y our job and e ducation; your living\nsituation; your hobbies and interests; your noncontroversial o bservations,\nopinions, and humor , who you \u2019re friends with; your family m akeup; and\nyour goals and plans for the future. People are generally comfortable\nsharing this information with anyone. Somewhat pers onal topics include  you r milder ins ecurities, flaws, and\ndoubts; your somewhat odder q uirks; your mildly embarrassing  or slightly\nemotionally hea vy past experiences; your somewhat more c ontroversial\nthoughts and humor; and your  less conventional, more ambitious future\ngoals. B ecause these details aren\u2019 t overly damaging or private, most people\nare f ine sharing them with some one who seems at least somewhat accepting\nand trus tworthy . They may get to this point in a conversation w ithin a few\nminutes. V ery personal topics include  y our deeper , m ore serious insecurities,\nflaws, and doubts; past experie nces that you\u2019re very ashamed of, whichmost peo ple wouldn\u2019 t understan d and which are quite emotionally heavy to\ntalk about; and y our opinions that are very controversial. In thei r day-to-day\nlives, most people only share these secrets with a select handful of very\nclose, trustwort hy friends. However , they may share a spec ific, highly\nprivate secret earlier than usual if they sense the other person has a similar\none and won\u2019 t judge them for it. Overall, disclos ing your emotions is seen as more vulne rable and\nrevealing than sharing factual information. For example, telling someone\nthat bei ng constantly criticized  by your parents made you feel sad and\nworthless will create more intimacy than just mentioning your mom was\nhard on you. Seeing the balance in self-disclosur e\nAs they open up to each other , people start with milder disclos ures, and if\nthey\u2019re m et with acceptance and understanding, they gradually move on to\nbigger ones. The expectation is that if the person you\u2019re talking to reveals\nsomething about themselves, you\u2019ll match them and disclose something\nsimilar (for example, they descri be how they were really stressed out during\ntheir last year of college. Y ou didn\u2019 t find college that stressful, but share\nhow you had a tough time adjusting to your first real-world job). If\nsomeone shares  with you and you don\u2019 t disclose in kind, it disrupts the\nprocess of deepening the relationship. The person who opened up may feel\nunfulfilled, rebuf fed, and perh aps a little unfairly exposed. If someone\nshares too many times and doesn\u2019 t get anything back in return, they may\ndecide they\u2019ve hit a limit on how close that friendship can get. Self-disclosure fosters intimacy , but sharing too much too soon puts\npeople of f. It puts them in an awkward spot. It\u2019 s emotional work  to take in a\nperson\u2019 s secrets  and problems and be supportive in response. If someone\nbarely k nows you, they may not be ready to do that work yet, but feelobligated becau se you sprung it on them. Many people see early\noversharing as a red flag that someone will be needy and dra ining in the\nrelationship. It also communicates that you lack the common sense to be\nchoosy about whom you share your private life with. That\u2019 s n ot to say you\u2019re alway s obligated to reciprocate when someone\nself-discloses to  you. Maybe you\u2019re fine keeping them as a more surface-\nlevel friend or professional col league. Maybe you\u2019ve just met them, and\nthey showed poor judgment by spilling their heaviest secrets to o soon, and\nthere\u2019 s no way y ou\u2019re doing the same. Maybe you\u2019re particularly guarded\nabout th at one topic, but are f ine opening up about other on es. Overall,\nthough, if you\u2019ve been getting to know someone, you\u2019re hittin g it of f, and\nthey share a som ewhat personal detail about themselves, you should self-\ndisclose back. Being overly guarded and secr etive\nOversharing is a faux pas, but some shyer , less secure people lean in the\nopposite directio n and are guarded and secretive beyond a regu lar , sensible\nlevel.

Young in age and pregnant with possibilities, early generations of Americans made more improve-ments to the proverbial mouse trap than there are stars in the sky. Before the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was a productive society, the vast major-ity of its citizens making more than 70 percent of their household items themselves. As the country became a consumer society, however, more and more items were bought rather than made at home. The availability of several new inventions, like the washer and dryer, pro-vided more leisure time. But with some of these inven-tions, lifestyles became very comfortable, and our collective creative skills became dull (Mander, 1978; Jackson, 2004). With the advent of television, it is said, the creative American mind began showing signs of atrophy. People now take a passive role in the creative process, letting other people do the important, creative thinking. Experts agree that a happy mind is a creative mind. The inability to deal with many problems is directly related to the inability to tap into and utilize creativity. It would be unfair to point the \ufb01  nger of blame solely at television.

Perhaps in an effort to address the needs of people search-ing to use journaling as a coping technique, several books have appeared on the market in the past decade provid-ing guidelines to the art of journal writing. The follow-ing is a compilation of tips, hints, and suggestions that appear to have the consensus of therapists who advocate this coping technique:\n 1. Centering. Before you begin to write, take a moment  \nto relax. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths,\n \nand try to unwind. Centering means to be well \ngrounded or well connected to the here and now. Sometimes playing soft music or sipping hot tea can help foster the centering process.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Identify your initial response. Do you feel angry , frus-\ntrated, afraid, impatient, or resentful? Does this\n \nstressor cause you to worry or feel guilty? What emotions are running through your mind? Write these down. Next, describe what your \ufb01  rst reaction \nor course of action to this stressor is (or was). Do you feel the urge to avoid a certain person? Do the words retaliation or avoidance come to mind? How \nwould you describe your \ufb01  rst course of action?</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>W e can\u2019 t\nalways be in the mood to talk about subjects like whether free will\ntruly exists. W ays to move past r outine small talk\nSmall talk is always going to be a part of conversations. The way out of it is\nthrough it. If you refuse to engage in it because it makes you f eel bored or\nimpatient, many of your interactions will never get of f the ground, and then\nyou\u2019ll su rely miss out on the possibility of having a deeper exchange. If you\nplay alo ng and know how to han dle small talk, it shouldn\u2019 t take more than a\nfew min utes to move into more interesting territory . Here\u2019 s what  you can do\nto help the process be faster and less painful:T ry to tap into the underlying friendly intent of the other per son\u2019 s\ncommunication, rather than the surface content. Realize th ey\u2019re\ntrying to connect with you, not annoy you. T ry not to simp ly see small ta lk as a deal breaker or an ordeal to\nendure. Refram e it as the opening round of a potentially good\nconversation. Think, \u201cIf I have to do this, I may as well use it to set\nup the conversation to go in an enjoyable direction.\u201d\nAccept t hat even  if you try to make the best of it, not every moment\nof every  conversation is going t o be fascinating for you. Sometimes\nit\u2019 s nece ssary to get through th ose boring bits because it helps you\nmeet other goals, like you want  to be friendly , or the other person is\nenthusiastic about the topic and you want to let them share it with\nyou. Whatever the other person says, even if you\u2019ve heard it a million\ntimes be fore, treat it like a legitimate contribution, and try to an swer\nwith enough substance and jumping-of f points to better topics. If they\nmention the weather , rather tha n thinking, \u201cUgh, do I have to talk\nabout th is?\u201d and  then answering with a flat \u201cY ep\u2026 sure is nice  out,\u201d\nyou cou ld cheerfully say , \u201cY eah, it\u2019 s really warm out.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Avoid manipulation. In the course of asserting yourself, you may \ufb01  nd that others may consciously \nor unconsciously try to block your efforts to accomplish resolution. The following are some roadblocks of manipulation to be aware of, as well as some suggested strategies that may help to dismantle them:\na. Intimidation. Asserting yourself may intimi-\ndate others who are in the habit of using ma-\nnipulation and control to get their way. They in turn may raise their voices and display their tempers. When you recognize this behavior, you can defuse it by saying that you want to hold off further discussion of this issue until the other person calms down. For example, \u201cI can see that you are quite angry; let\u2019s talk about this after lunch.\u201d\nb. Content substitution. Sometimes people will \ndraw peripheral issues into a discussion to derail the issue at hand. If you become aware that the concern you brought up has become lost in tangential issues, quickly shift focus back to the original topic until your issue has been put to rest. c. Personal attacks (character assassination). You \nmay \ufb01  nd that in an attempt to resolve an issue, \nthe person you are talking to comes back at you with a character \ufb02\n aw. One way to get \nback on track is to agree, in part, about the character \ufb02  aw and ignore the rest. Davis calls this response clouding, the attempt to de\ufb02  ect \nan attack by concurring with some part of it. When employing this technique, rephrase the attack in your best interest, and get back to the issue at hand.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This\nmoment may not always come,  and sometimes you\u2019ll have to straight out\ncut them of f (fo r example, \u201cSorry , I know you\u2019re in the middle of your\nstory , bu t I have to go catch up with my friend\u201d). They may get a bit\nof fended, but you don\u2019 t have anything to feel bad about.

Metcalf suggests for the best response to play some Baroque music, light a candle, and have a pad (unlined paper works best) and pen ready at hand. She also suggests setting dedicated writing time several times a week for no less than half an hour each time. With the focus on writing from one\u2019s heart space, one writes with focused awareness to dissolve one\u2019s inhibitions (fears) and builds a foundation to build trust from within. Metcalf\u2019s style is to frequently have the writer ask him- or herself the question: What do I mean by _____?

Behavioral psy-chologists suggest altering one undesirable behavior at a time as the best method. Many behavior theories, including self-monitoring, clas-\nsical conditioning, operant conditioning, and modeling, suggest that behaviors can indeed be changed. From the nature of these theories and the research that led to them, it can be seen that there is no one best way to change behavior. The current school of thought is that the best approach to behavioral change is a multimodal approach (also called the biopsychosocial or holistic model) wherein many theories and their related techniques are combined in an attempt to produce a lasting effect. One major focus of all these theories is self-esteem. It appears that low self-esteem is associated with virtually every stress-related behavior. Therefore, it has taken on major importance with regard to behavior modi\ufb01  cation, particularly as it \nrelates to assertiveness and assertiveness skills. Assertiveness\nAssertiveness is described as the ability to be comfort-ably strong-willed about one\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and actions; and neither inhibited nor aggressive in actions for the betterment of oneself in the surrounding envi-ronment.

Behavior styles at either end of the continuum are conducive to stress:\n \u0081 \u0081 \u0081\n Passive Assertive  Aggressive \n behavior behavior behavior \nStress often produces many needs. Speci\ufb01  cally, it pro-\nduces the need to express one\u2019s feelings; other needs are often an offshoot of these expressions. The need to be assertive exists when situations arise that involve con-tact with other people. The assertive style, rather than the passive or aggressive, is advocated to minimize feel-ings of anger or fear associated with stressful encoun-ters, and to work toward a peaceful resolution. The following is a more detailed explanation of these three dominant personality styles:\n 1. Passive behavior style. The passive style is where \none is too intimidated to express thoughts and feelings. As a result, the person usually forfeits his or her rights and freedoms. A person employing this style comes across as shy and gives in to other people\u2019s demands so he or she will be more easily accepted. A passive style avoids confrontations at any cost. Consequently, this style makes one feel used and taken advantage of. The passive style is thought to be anxiety driven, yet the enactment of passive behavior results in feelings of resentment and victimization. The passive style is often employed by the codependent personality. 2.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Don\u2019 t mumble or talk into your chest. Don\u2019 t speak too quickly in a rush to get your point out or not take up\ntoo much time. Be reasonably concise. Know what you want to get across, rather\nthan rambling on. T ry to cut down on filler words and sounds such as \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n(if you need a moment to think, being silent for a split second is\nbetter). Everyone uses filler words sometimes, but overdoing it can\nmake you seem ditzy . Overall expr essivenessIn addition to your facial expressions, expressiveness comes from varying\nyour voice and t he gestures you make. If your face is always a blank mask,\nyou speak in a monotone, and you don\u2019 t move your hands or body much,\nyou\u2019ll seem flat and bored, and  be hard to read. On the other hand, being\noverly e xpressive and animate d can make you seem fake, flighty , or\nagitated. Aim to hit whatever the typical level of expressiveness is for yo ur culture. If y ou\u2019re under -expressive, you \u2019ll have to consciously force yourself to\ngesture more often and put on a smile when you want to seem cheerful. More than with many of these points, this feels very clunky and unnatural at\nfirst, but showing a wider range of emotion will feel more normal in time. Again, as you get more comfortable in your own skin, y ou\u2019ll likely\nnaturally start to be more expre ssive. If you\u2019re over -expressive you\u2019ll need\nto do  the  opposi te and tone dow n your gestures and facial expre ssions. This\ncan also  feel artificial and restrictive at first, but will become easier with\ntime. Body language\nIn d ay-to-day social situations,  you want body language that makes you\nseem relatively confident, relaxed, friendly , approachable, and happy . This\ninvolves\nhaving open body language;\nholding yourself in a loose, non-tense, and non-rigid way;\nabsence of nervous or fidgety gestures like rubbing your hands on\nyour pants or tapping your foot;\nabsence of unintentionally bored or disrespectful-seeming actions,\nlike looking around the room or fiddling with nearby objects. Y ou want your body languag e to seem self-assured, but c asual andrelaxed. If you c ome of f as over ly confident, you will seem like you belong\nat a sales convention, not a ho-hum social gathering. Y ou also d on\u2019 t want to\nveer into confrontational or overly dominant territory (that is, standing with\nyour che st puf fe d out, body to o rigid and rooted in place, hands planted\ndefiantly on your hips, invading  other people\u2019 s space, or resting  your hands\non peop le\u2019 s sho ulders). Sure, maybe you\u2019ll need to act like that if you\u2019re\nliving in a rough neighborhood where only the strong survive. But in most\nsocial situations , that kind of body language will either mak e you look\nangry and unstable, or like you\u2019 re a jerk who\u2019 s trying too hard t o be the top\ndog at the expense of connecting with people in a friendlier way . Postur e\nThe most attractive, confident p osture is when you\u2019re standing u pright with\nyour head and s houlders back, though not in a standing-at-attention way . There ar e two main types of poor posture. The first is slouch ing\u2014when\nyour sh oulders are hunched and rounded, and your head juts too far\nforward. The second is  ante rior pelvic tilt , wh ich makes y ou look like yo u\nhave a potbelly , even if you\u2019re thin. This poor posture occurs when your\nhips tilt too far downward and your lower back arches too far inward,\ncausing your butt and stomach to stick out. Posture problem s are caused by muscle imbalances that pull your body\nout of alignment . In slouching, t he chest muscles are tight, while  the ones in\nthe back  are relatively weak. W ith the anterior pelvic tilt, the lower back\nand hip flexors (the muscles nea r your hips that raise your knee up) are too\ntight, wh ile the abs and butt are weaker . These issues can dev elop due to\nfactors l ike slum ping in front of a computer too much, compensa ting for old\ninjuries, or simply from entrenched habits.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>I has enough faith in herself to see her through \na crisis.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Emblems and illustrators.

Remember that coping with stress involves changing perceptions that are threatening. Prayer (in whatever form, whether it be a Hail Mary or a positive af\ufb01 rmation) is a way in which to allay the fear involved. Similarly, faith for believers is trust in the unknown, whereas faith for non-believers may be viewed as an inter-nal locus of control. Like prayer, faith is subjective, mean-ing that it comes from a personal experience, not something learned in a book. Intention is paramount.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>There are dif ferent levels of alcohol\nconsumption. So meone who has a beer or two while seeing som e live music\nisn\u2019 t consuming it on the same level as a guy who gets blackou t drunk at a\nparty and puts his hand through  a window . It\u2019 s often not drinking itself we\nfeel neg ative about but the things it can become associated with. When\nyou\u2019re y oung, u nderage drinkin g has all this baggage attached  to it that it\ndoesn\u2019 t when you\u2019re 45 and sipp ing a scotch in the evening. Y ou may have\ncome to  dislike drinking becaus e it\u2019 s a favorite activity of a type of person\nyou resent. It would be foolish to say there\u2019 s nothing wrong with alcohol. It has a lot\nof p otential downsides, from se rious ones like addiction and dr unk driving\naccidents, to more minor annoyances like losing your phone when you\u2019re\nloaded or putting on weight afte r two semesters of partying. Ho wever , most\nof the time nothing bad happens to people when they drink in moderation. They go out, sh are a few pitche rs, feel the ef fects, and then head home for\nthe night. Even when they ge t pretty drunk, most people still behave\nthemselves. They may be louder , sloppier , and goofier than normal, but\nthat\u2019 s ab out it on most nights. If  you\u2019re someplace where a lot of people are\ndrinking, it\u2019 s easy to spot the handful of people who are acting\nembarrassing or being self-destructive, but for every one of them, there are\nfifty who have their act together . Some thoughts on developing a mor e balanced view of clubbing\nIf yo u ca n take or leave giant, gaudy nightclubs, you\u2019re not alon e. They can\nbe lo ud, crowded, expensive, an d full of people who aren\u2019 t your style. Lots\nof people don\u2019 t like them but s till manage to have great social  lives whilesetting f oot in them as rarely as possible. As with drinking, complaints\nabout clubbing are most commonly heard from people in their late teens\nand early  twenties, when everyone is most enthusiastic about go ing to them. Most people who go to clubs are good, regular folk. If you\u2019ve been\ndragged to a clu b, it\u2019 s easy to think that everyone but you is empty-headed\nand lives for that kind of scene, but a lot of people are occasional club-\ngoers, who may have been cajoled into going too. The clubbing\nenvironment also makes people seem more ditzy than they are. Who doesn\u2019 t\ncome across as more superficial in a clubbing outfit? Everyone\u2019 s also there\nto let loose and have fun, so th ey\u2019re not showing the more refined side of\ntheir personality . Don\u2019 t be too quick to dismiss specific aspects of clubbing. Y ou may not\nlike dancing to t humping dance music, but that doesn\u2019 t automatically mean\neveryone who does is a mouth-breather . Similarly , many people go to clubs\nfor face- value re asons like wanting to see their friends and cut loose after a\nlong week. Not everyone has a less-flattering hidden motivation like\nwanting to get la id or soak up attention from strangers. Finally , n ot all clubs\nare t he s ame. When people first start going out, they often gra vitate to the\nbiggest, most stereotypically clu b-ish clubs and mistakenly think they\u2019re all\nlike that.

Time and money. For \nmost people, it seems as if every stressor involves time and money because these two resources are constantly in high demand \nand often squandered. Would you agree?</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Persuasion. Persuasion is de\ufb01  ned as an attempt to\n  \nalter another person\u2019s attitude or behavior. It is believed by some scholars that all verbal expression is rooted in persuasion. When persuasion is used to win a con\ufb02  ict at the expense of others, it is viewed as negative. But persuasion can be a positive style as well. In the initial stage of the con\ufb02  ict-resolution \nprocess, all voices need to be heard. Persuasion may include the use of reason, emotional awareness, or motivation to get a point across. When used tact-fully, persuasion opens new lines of thinking, which can then be tools to resolve issues and pro-mote mutual agreement. 5. Dialogue. Dialogue is a verbal exchange of opin-ions, attitudes, facts, and perceptions that opens the doors to greater understanding of the nature of the problem. During the dialogue process, dis-cussions center on the costs and bene\ufb01  ts of solving \na problem. Dialogue involves the same steps as those employed for creative problem solving (see Chapter 13). In dialogue, negotiations are a means to a solution to which all parties feel they have made a contribution. Compromise plays an important role in the dialogue process because the intent is to reach a decision that is agreeable to everyone.Steps to Enhance \nCommunication Skills\nThe following are additional suggestions to strengthen \nyour communication skills and help promote con\ufb02  ict \nresolution.

Seeing why people may not show empathy\nSometimes people come across as unsympathetic and insensitive without\nmeaning to. They often aren\u2019 t aware that they\u2019re not responding  in the most\nappropriate manner . Here are some reasons why people may not show\nempathy:\nThey\u2019re socially inexperienced, and either it isn\u2019 t on their rada r that\nthey should care about other people\u2019 s feelings and perspectives, or\nthey kno w they should, but they aren\u2019 t very practiced at it. They  mayunconsciously have a mind-set of \u201cThis is how I would feel in this\nsituation, so everyone else will be the same.\u201d\nThey do n\u2019 t know how to show they\u2019re concerned or caring, or it\nmakes th em fee l flustered and a wkward. If a friend is upset, they\u2019re\nnot sure what to do with themselves, so they say nothing. They may\ncome of f as emo tionally blank because they\u2019re too stuck in their head\nworrying that they don\u2019 t know how to respond properly . They have more logical, detach ed personalities and just don\u2019 t g et as\nemotional about things. News that may upset some people, like a\nchild fro m across the country going missing, doesn\u2019 t get to them\nbecause they think, \u201cW ell, I d on\u2019 t know them personally , so why\nshould i t af fect me?\u201d What someone else sees as an insult, they  may\nsee as a dry , rational critique. People with a more solitary , independent social style sometimes\nunintentionally b ecome too focused on their own needs and for get to\nconsider everyone else\u2019 s. It\u2019 s not that they\u2019re selfish monsters, just\nthat they develop some thoughtl ess habits as a side ef fect of spe nding\nmost of their time in circumsta nces where they only have to w orry\nabout what\u2019 s best for them. People w ho are going through a lot of stress and emotional tu rmoil\nwill naturally focus on their own problems. When people are younger , especially in their teenage years, their\nempathy sometimes hasn\u2019 t fully developed simply because they\nhaven\u2019 t had enough life experience. They haven\u2019 t encoun tered\nenough h ardship or been exposed to many contrasting worldviews, so\nthey hav e a tougher time relating to people who are hurting or  who\nsee things dif ferently than they do. The above are benign, accidental reasons someone could seem insensitive,\nbut the fact is, s ome people lack empathy because they have a s elfish, self-absorbed, arrog ant, or close-minded side to their personality .

If the new mind frame worked, repeat this process with stressors that demand a change in attitude to resolve and bring closure. Some Additional Tips for \nCognitive Restructuring\n 1. Initiate a relaxation technique to calm your mind. When a relaxation technique is employed, the mind begins to unwind and consciousness shifts from an analytical mode to one of receptivity. In this unwinding process, unimportant thoughts begging the conscious mind for attention are dis-missed, allowing greater receptivity to a wider perspective on the issue at hand. A wider perspec-tive in turn fosters personal enlightenment and opens up room for positive thoughts. (See Chap-ter 18, \u201cMeditation.\u201d)\n 2. Take responsibility for your own thoughts. In times of stress we may feel victimized. We may also feel that things are out of our control. A way to gain temporary control is to blame others for the per-sonal injustice of the perceived stressor. Blame is associated with guilt and guilt can be a toxic thought. If you \ufb01  nd yourself blaming others for \nevents that make you feel victimized, ask yourself how you can turn this blame into personal respon-sibility for your own thoughts and feelings with-\nout\n feeling guilty. 3.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Creative.

It is quite possible for some of these theories to blend or \ncombine together to explain the laughter response. For example, if the Queen of England were to tell a Polish joke (which she hasn\u2019t done), it could be interpreted as an argument for superiority theory. However, laughter could also arise from the incongruity of this sense of humor among royalty, or even the release of anxiety from the perception of ethnic jokes as taboo. Despite the differ-ent theories as to why we laugh, one idea is agreed upon: Humor helps us cope with the stress of everyday life. Humor Therapy as a \nCoping Technique\nIn simplest terms, the use of humor is a defense mecha-\nnism. Yet, unlike other conscious or unconscious defense strategies to protect the ego, such as rationalization and projection, humor seems to dissolve the walls of the ego rather than intensify them. Humor is the one defense mechanism that can increase pleasure and reduce pain at the same moment; it gives two effects for the price of one. Theorists agree that humor is an adaptive coping mechanism liberating the ego. A 1978 article in Psy-\n cho logy Today asserted that the average person laughs about \ufb01  fteen times per day. Although this study has been updated, one might infer, given the state of the world today, that the quota of 15 laughs per day is not being met. Humor\u2019s greatest asset is to balance the emo-tional scale between positive and negative perceptions. Although the study of psychology has maintained a particular bent toward the darker side of the human psyche, even this is beginning to change, in both the focus of research and the application of psycho therapy. Many psychologists argue that the expression of laugh-ter and smiling is nothing less than a catharsis of emo-tions, a physical release tied to emotional thoughts. Overall, a well-intended catharsis can be quite healthy to the mind and body. But the complexity of humor hints of something more than just catharsis. In any event, mirth serves as a catalyst to unite mind, body, and spirit for total well-being.Humor can be used to diffuse both anger and anxiety, and it can be quite powerful at reducing both emotions. Frank Prerost (1987), of Western Illinois University, con-ducted a study on the use of humor as catharsis for aggres-sion. Subjects (144 women) were \ufb01  rst measured with a Health Locus of Control survey. Then, they were asked to rate the funniness of twelve jokes. Results indicated that aggression-based humor was the most effective in allowing a catharsis of anger in women with an internal locus of control. Research by Leftcourt and Martin (1986) and Porter\ufb01  eld (1987) also indicates that humor acts as a \u201cstress buffer,\u201d or moderator, to decrease the impact of stressful experiences, particularly the anxiety of major life-event changes and everyday annoyances. Frankl, the survivor of Auschwitz discussed in earlier \nchapters, noted in his book Man\u2019s Search for Meaning \nthat humor was a saving grace among fellow prisoners in the shadows of death. Frankl wrote, \u201cHumor was another of the soul\u2019s weapons in the \ufb01  ght for self-pres-ervation.\u201d Fear of death even has its own brand of mirth: black humor. People often joke about death and dying in an effort to ease their tension and perhaps better understand their own mortal plight. Hollywood often uses comic relief in horror movies (e.g., 28 Days Later and Scary Movie) so that the audience isn\u2019t so emotion-\nally spent that they miss the \ufb01  lm\u2019s climactic scene. It is virtually impossible to be both angry and happy at the same time. Thus, if you can separate yourself from your aggression for a moment and see how silly and out of character prolonged anger really is, feelings of hostility dissipate, succumbing to a crescendo of mirth. For this reason, self-parody is thought to be the type of humor best suited to dispel anger. In the book The Healing Power of Humor, Klein (1989) \nstates that the use of humor gives a sense of power in the \nmidst of chaos. Being able to make light of a stressful circumstance allows people to feel they have control over a situation. Humor becomes a weapon to disarm the cause of the stress response. Whereas some consider humor as a catalyst to tap the power of intelligence and emotional fortitude, others see it as a diversion tactic. In this case, humor allows for an intermission in the cogni-tive war against stressors and a \u201ccease-\ufb01  re\u201d of the stress response.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Consider keeping a section of your journal for \ncreative ideas, doodling, and photo collages. Best Application of Journal Writing\nGood-quality journal writing has several purposes. The \ufb01 rst is to act as a personal sounding board\u2014to cleanse \nthe mind overloaded with perceptions, emotions, and toxic thoughts. Journal writing is a great way to vent anger. In moments of rage, a verbal description helps pinpoint how and why these feelings are surfacing. Sometimes writing how you feel, and perhaps what you should have said or would like to say, becomes a draft script to resolve issues between you and the person(s) involved in your perceived stress. Writing down feel-ings of anxiety and apprehension is a good release of emotions that can drain your energy. Effective coping involves the ability to access and employ both internal and external resources. The second purpose is to map out strategies for resolu-\ntion, both attitudinal perceptions and behavioral changes. Depending on the situation, these two pur-poses can be used as an offensive tactic in the face of stress, or in strategic planning when in momentary retreat. As an offensive tactic, journal writing can be used to cope with an immediate problem. Just by pull-ing out a pad of paper and pen and writing down what is on your mind, thoughts become organized and order begins to emerge from chaos. In many stressful events, however, this option is not possible. Then journal writ-ing can be used as a postponed coping response, perhaps at the end of the day, to collect your thoughts and pro-cess major events\u2014those chronic stressors\u2014that need attention. Last, a periodic review of journal entries serves to increase awareness of trends and patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Recognition of trends is the \ufb01  rst step in changing undesired or negative thoughts and actions in an effort to reach your highest human potential and enjoy inner peace. Although the primary resource needed for journal writing is a single notebook, you might consider having two: one very private one to be used exclusively at home, and a second one, perhaps less structured, to be used at work. Personal computers have added a whole new dimen-\nsion to journal writing that was inconceivable just two decades ago. Many people have found that using a word processor actually allows them to write as fast as they think, thereby enabling them to capture the essence of several thoughts simultaneously, rather than \ufb01  ghting to retrieve some. If you \ufb01  nd it easier to type entries in a personal computer \ufb01  le than in a note-book, give it a try. 240\n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   24056147_CH10_229_243.indd   240 9/29/08   11:07:17 PM9/29/08   11:07:17 PM241 Journal Writing\nI Journal writing has been used as a form of self-\nexpression and soul searching for centuries. Psycho-logists and health educators have advocated journal writing for decades as a means to increase self-awareness on issues that need attention. I Journal writing is said to promote emotional catharsis when thoughts, perceptions, attitudes, values, beliefs, and the tensions these create are allowed to work themselves out on paper. I Use of soul searching is no coincidence as a stress-management technique because this activity is the epitome of the emptying process. I There are short-term and long-term effects of habitual journal writing. Short-term bene\ufb01  ts \ninclude releasing pent-up feelings of anger and anxiety. When a series of journal entries is reread, long-term effects include seeing patterns and habits of thought, perceptions, and behaviors that are not detectable on an entry-to-entry basis. Putting thoughts down on paper also widens one\u2019s perspective to become more receptive to solutions and resolutions to stressors. I An additional bene\ufb01  t, demonstrated by \nPennebaker, is that writing about personal expe-riences in a journal increases the integrity of the immune system. Expressive writing has also proved to bene\ufb01  t \ufb01 bromyalsia patients, wives of \nU.S. servicemen, as well as decrease resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels. I Not all journal entries have to be written in prose form. Poetry therapy is likened to making order out of personal chaos. This coping style is used in many settings, including prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, and counseling centers. I There is no wrong way to write a journal, save writing too infrequently. This chapter gave a number of guidelines for effective journal writ-ing, including several themes (Buzan, dreams, and unsent letters) that can add variety to your repertoire of entry styles.SUMMARY\nSTUDY GUIDE QUESTIONS\n 1. Explain how journaling is used as an effective \ncoping technique.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>S ometimes\nyou\u2019ll want to know the answer  to a question that\u2019 s simple to re ply to, or it\nwill be all you can think to say at that moment. Just be aware that you may\nnot get a good a nswer and will need to have another contributi on ready to\ngo ( for e xample, \u201cDid you have fun on vacation?\u201d, \u201cY ep.\u201d, \u201cGood to hear . What would you say was the highlight?\u201d). Statements\nA statement could be an answer to a question, an opinion, an observation,\nsome inf ormation, or sharing something relevant that happened to you. The\nmain gu ideline w hen making statements is that you want to say something\nwith enough substance or \u201cjumping-of f points\u201d to provide your\nconversation partner with plenty of ideas about what they could say next. If\nyou\u2019re answering a question, provide enough details.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Perhaps the landmark study of the power of support \ngroups was designed by Spiegel and colleagues (1989). This study showed that metastatic breast cancer patients who were involved with a support group lived statisti-cally signi\ufb01  cantly longer than those who did not belong \nto such a group. Spiegel called this coping technique supportive-expressive group therapy . Connectedness, \nthrough the loving support of friends, family, and col-leagues, appears to be an essential factor for optimal health (Ornish, 1998). The direct-effect theory , suggested \nby Andrews and Tennant (1982), indicates that social contact only provides positive exposure to the individual and that these positive stimuli are pleasing to the ego. Finally, the cognitive-dissonance theory states that when individuals are engaged in social contact where values and attitudes are similar, the collective energy far exceeds the negative feelings experienced by any one person individually. Pilisuk and Parks (1986) found evidence supporting the \nhypothesis that social support not only acts as a buffer against stress, but may in fact contribute to health and lon-gevity by enhancing the integrity of the immune system. Results from both the Alameda County Study (Berkman and Syme, 1979) and the Tecumseh Commu nity Health Study (House, Robbins, and Metzner, 1982) revealed that social support was a signi\ufb01  cant factor in both the health status and longevity of those subjects studied. These inves-tigations, as well as those conducted by Kaplan and col-leagues (1988) and Berkman (1986), indicated that men seem to bene\ufb01  t more than women with regard to the effects of social support on the progression of cardiovascu-lar disease. Raphael (1977) and Lowenthal and Harven (1968) reported that social withdrawal was a signi\ufb01  cant \nfactor in coronary mortality in bereaved spouses, most notably men. From these and other studies, it seems that companionship is truly a basic human need. When this need is \ufb01  lled through the demonstration of caring, love, and moral support, the intensity of stress is alleviated, sug-gesting a greater tolerance for frustration and worry. In their reviews of the merits of social support as a coping technique, Brannon and Feist (1992) and Pelletier and Herzing (1988) concluded that it is a signi\ufb01  cant factor \ncontributing to health and longevity. Thus, its use as a coping strategy is strongly encouraged. Hobbies\nIs there such a thing as a therapeutic escape? Perhaps. Whereas psychologists and stress-management coun-selors caution against the hazards of avoidance, the practice of diversions has often been advocated as a bona \ufb01 de coping strategy. Healthy diversions are any activi-\nties that offer a temporary escape from the sensory over-load that can produce or perpetuate the stress response. Diversions offer the conscious mind a \u201cchange of venue\u201d to promote clear thinking. Taking your mind off a problem, or removing an issue from conscious attention for a designated period of time, and diverting attention to an unrelated subject focuses the mind and enables it to deal better with these issues upon return. As with most strategies, diversions offer either positive or nega-tive repercussions. Positive diversions are those in which the individual takes an active role  in the escape process. (An example of a passive escape is watching television or sleeping.) Active escapes are those that contribute to one\u2019s identity, character, and self-esteem. With this in mind, the best temporary active escape is said to be a \nSupportive-expressive group therapy: A term \ncoined by Dr. David Spiegel for women with breast cancer to share their experiences, grief, and healing with others going through the same experience. Direct-effect theory: A theory suggesting that \nsocial contact serves to provide uplifting aspects to the individual, thus pleasure to the ego. Cognitive-dissonance theory: A theory suggesting \nthat the collective energy of one\u2019s support group supersedes any individual\u2019s negative experience of stress.The term \u201csocial support group\u201d has taken on a whole \nnew meaning because of new arenas of social net-working, including MySpace.com, Facebook.com, and other forums not yet created. In an age where the world is at your \ufb01  ngertips (through a keypad), friends are as close as the farthest corner of the globe.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

Here are some of the more well-recognized theo-ries of human behavior as applied to the practice of behavior modi\ufb01  cation. Understanding the nature of these theories may help you to modify your behavior. Classical Conditioning. The concept of classical condi-\ntioning was \ufb01  rst described by Russian physiologist Ivan  \nPavlov in the late 1920s. Pavlov\u2019s theory, based on his\n \nresearch with dogs, suggests that animals become condi-\ntioned to speci\ufb01  c stimuli to act in a speci\ufb01  c way. What Pavlov observed was that his dogs began to salivate when they heard a bell that they associated with food. People, like dogs, can also become conditioned to behave in a cer-tain way. In this regard, when a stimulus is coupled with a physiological re\ufb02  ex, the result can be a behavior with some pretty deep roots, one that can take years to unlearn. I am reminded of a student of mine who, upon listening to a relaxation tape with the natural sound of a brook, felt the undeniable urge to go to the bathroom. Slightly embarrassed, she approached me after class and told me that she felt very uncomfortable with the tape. When she was a young child, she told me, her mother, who often was in a hurry to do shopping or errands, would run the water in the bathroom to get her to urinate quickly. Now whenever she hears running water, she gets the urge to go to the bathroom. Operant Conditioning.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Ask questions to improve clarity of statements . When \nyou are at a loss to understand facts, concepts, or feelings expressed to you, questions become imperative. But beware. Questions can sometimes put the speaker on the defensive. Use questions to clarify your understanding, not to confuse the person you are listening to. 7. Use empathy to re\ufb02  ect and share feelings . Empathy \nis thought to be an important attending skill that galvanizes the listening experience. Empathy refers to attention to the speaker\u2019s feelings as well as thoughts. This does not imply that you must adopt these feelings as your own.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>The reality of the situation is not \npleasant in the best of moments. A common theme found among the theories of many psy cho logists in these cases is acceptance (see Chapter 4). The acceptance of situations we have no control over is thought to be paramount as a stress-management strategy, yet it is perhaps the hardest frame of mind to adopt. There is a \ufb01  ne line between control and acceptance. This is the essence of Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s Serenity Prayer for Al co hol ics Anony mous: \u201cLord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d Acceptance is not an \u201covernight sen-sation,\u201d but rather an attitude that may take several days, weeks, or months to adopt and implement.

Before you begin to write, take a moment  \nto relax. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths,\n \nand try to unwind. Centering means to be well \ngrounded or well connected to the here and now.

Although for centuries dreams have been regarded as an intriguing aspect of human nature, their importance to mental and emotional stability has been neglected for quite some time. It was not until the work of Freud that these nocturnal images produced by the unconscious mind were considered worthy of scienti\ufb01  c \ninvestigation. Like Hippocrates in ancient Greece, Freud discovered that dreams were closely related to the physical symptoms many of his patients demon-strated. It was this insight that led Freud into the study of dreams and dream analysis. Calling dreams \u201cthe royal road to the unconscious,\u201d \nFreud (1950) became convinced that they act to disguise sexual desires and thought. It was his exploration in the \ufb01 eld of dreams that paved the way to a greater scienti\ufb01  c \nunderstanding of the unconscious mind. But, whereas Freud viewed dreams as a means to conceal conscious \nthoughts, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jung, regarded dreams as a means to reveal a whole new language to understand human \nconsciousness and restore psychic balance. The work of these two men gave birth to the modern practice of dream therapy . Today, this work continues with dream \nresearchers Gayle Delaney (1988), Patrick Gar\ufb01  eld \n(1995), and Robert Van de Castle (1995). The popularity of dream interpretation with the Amer-\nican public waxed and waned throughout the twentieth century in tandem with that expressed in clinical research.

T h e  N o . 1  t h i n g  t o  r e m e m b e r  a b o u t  c o n v e r s a t i o n\nm i s t a k e s\nEveryone makes  mistakes while conversing from time to time. It\u2019 s great to\nsteer clear of as many bad habits as possible, but don\u2019 t put too much strain\non yourself to be  flawless when you talk to people. No one gets it right 100\npercent of the ti me. Also, even if you converse in a way that most people\nfind acceptable, you\u2019ll encounte r the occasional person who ha s a dif ferent\nperspective and sees something  as a mistake on your part (for example,\nsomeone who\u2019 s overly sensitive may take of fense to normal af fectionate\nteasing). Don\u2019 t let a fear of making a mistake paralyze you. Many so-called\nmistakes aren\u2019 t ideal, but they\u2019 re not that  bad , and the conversation will\noften co ntinue ju st fine. For example, it\u2019 s not great to brag, but if you subtly\ntalk yourself up one time, most people aren\u2019 t instantly going to be turned\nof f. They may n ot even see it as bragging to begin with, just y ou stating a\nfact about yourself.If you\u2019r e just getting the hang of making conversation and are anxious\nabout getting rejected or making a bad impression, you can get so worried\nabout all  the behaviors you have  to avoid that your mind goes bl ank. Saying\nsomething less- than-perfect is often better than saying nothin g at all. At\nleast that way you\u2019re keeping the conversation going and giving the other\nperson s omething to react to. F or example, if you mildly brag  about how\ngood you are a t drawing, the other person may start talking about how\nthey\u2019re into art as well. If you catch yourself making a bigger mistake, you can usually smooth it\nover by apologizing for it. Don\u2019 t say you\u2019re sorry in too serious a tone. Just\nquickly , casually  acknowledge what you did wrong, then get on with the\ndiscussion. For example, \u201cWhoops, I just cut you of f. Sorry about that.

What gives?\u201d There  are a few\nexplanations:\nSome \u201cbad\u201d behaviors ar e okay in certain situations. As Chapter\n14 e xplained, it\u2019 s acceptable in loud, rowdy group conversations for\npeople to interrupt and talk ove r each other as they try to make  their\npoints heard. Some \u201cbad\u201d behaviors ar e accepted in particular subcultur es or\nsocial gr oups. I n a gro up of young, bro-ish guys, mild bragging may\nbe comm on and acceptable. A circle of intellectual friends may be\nfine with members correcting each other .Individuals vary in which social mistakes bother them. Someone\nwho\u2019 s n ot a big talker themse lves may have fewer issues with a\nmonopolizer . So meone with a crasser sense of humor may not mind a\nless-sensitive friend.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>b. The Pareto principle states that 20 percent of \nthe tasks we do give 80 percent of the rewards or satisfaction (Reh, 2008). Also referred to as the 80/20 Rule, this principle suggests that in-dividuals should focus on one or two signi\ufb01  -\ncant tasks that are worth the time invested in them. According to this principle, out of every ten responsibilities listed, only two will pro-duce recognizable gains. These tasks should be given attention and time. (These two tasks will most likely fall in the A category, suggest-ing that completion of C, and even B, items may prove unfruitful in the long run.)\nc. Sometimes it is dif\ufb01  cult to differentiate among \nresponsibilities, all of which seem important, what to do \ufb01\n rst. One answer is to employ \nStephen Covey\u2019s important-versus-urgent \nmethod (Box 15.1) as highlighted in his best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Divide your responsibilities for the day (or week) into four boxes. Note that peo-ple tend to direct their energies toward box IV (Not urgent, Not important) because these responsibilities look quick, easy, and perhaps enjoyable. Covey suggests that one\u2019s overrid-ing attention should go to the box labeled II (Important but not Urgent) because this will yield the highest results. Box I (Important and Urgent) needs adequate time, but this is not where the majority of your attention should be placed, for it will only lead to a reactionary lifestyle. Covey suggests that it\u2019s not time that needs to be managed but ourselves that need attention. Quadrant II is the key to effective personal management. 2.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>it\u2019s not this simple. What the makers of the video failed to include (although \nthis may be revealed in subsequent sequels) is the power of ego-driven thoughts from the subconscious mind (a portion of the unconscious mind). So much of our behavior (some experts think all of it) is directed by our unconscious minds. Perhaps this concept is best illus-trated by the famous actor Buster Keaton (and imitated by Johnny Depp in the movie Benny and Joon) who tries in vain to pick up his hat but repeatedly seems to kick it out of his reach before he can grab it. If the conscious mind and the unconscious minds are not acting together, all the intentions and reframing in the world aren\u2019t going to help. In the \ufb01  eld of psychology this is known as the \u201cunconscious resistance,\u201d a self-sabotaging effect that undermines the conscious mind\u2019s best efforts to make (positive) things happen.

Y ou\u2019re extra nervous in situati ons where your feared subjects aremore lik ely to come up, like if everyone\u2019 s drinking, getting l oose-\ntongued, and talking about their love lives. Y ou get touchy and defensive  when people ask you innocuous\nquestions related to your secrets (for example, \u201cWhat are your friends\nup to this weekend?\u201d). Y ou use  a variety of strategies t o avoid sharing anything about your\nsecret: changing the subject; giving vague, evasive answers; straight-\nup l ying; hanging back in grou ps and not contributing; shifting the\nattention to someone else; or finding ways to leave the conversation\njust as you\u2019re about to be put on the spot. Being o verly gu arded, for whatever reason, is a self-defeating strategy . It\u2019 s stressful to carry around a bunch of supposedly shameful secrets and\nworry about what will happen i f someone finds out about them . Ironically ,\nsecretiveness can create more problems than it helps avoid. If you have a\nsecret, no one m ay think it\u2019 s a big deal if they find out what it  is, but they\nwon\u2019 t form the best impression of you if you\u2019re always closed-of f and\ncagey . Their imagination may ru n wild and assume something w orse about\nyou than what you\u2019re actually hiding. Or they may simply think you\u2019re not\ninterested in being friends with them when you continually rebuf f their\nattempts to grow closer . How to become less guarded and open up to people\nY ou can  find ways to be less g uarded and more open with pe ople. First,\nchange your attitude about wha t it means to reveal your flaws. If you\u2019re\nguarded, you probably believe t hat others will reject you if they learn about\nyour weaknesses. Similarly , yo u may think that the way to be liked is to\ncome across as flawless and impressive. Actually , the opposite is true. When you reveal your vulnerabilities and rough edges, you seemendearingly hum an. When you act like you have no flaws, you become\ndistant and unrelatable. It\u2019 s cloying when someone seems too perfect and\ntogether . Many secrets are only shamefu l and embarrassing if you feel they are. Maybe y ou don\u2019 t have many friends at the moment.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

Lots of people who ar e indif ferent to fashion have g ood\nsocial lives. However , polishing your appearance wouldn\u2019 t hurt.

Y ou\ncan also upload some photos of yourself in typical outfits to fashion-related\nmessage boards online and get feedback. Say you learn you could stand to polish your style. People often have\nstronger reaction s to the idea of having to dress better than they do to things\nlike improving their posture or speaking volume:\nMany people have been picked on in their youth for wearing the\n\u201cwrong\u201d clothes  by peers who seemed overly concerned with the\nsuperficial parts  of life. When these people are older , they carry\nbaggage about dressing well. They see it as shallow and may even\nfeel like they\u2019re letting the enemy \u201cwin\u201d if they begin to focus on it\nthemselves. More generally , someone may not personally care much aboutfashion and resent the fact that they\u2019re forced to devote ener gy to it\nbecause the rest of the world thinks it\u2019 s important. Some sh y , self-conscious peop le have a fear of standing out and\nmaking waves. One way they un consciously manage it is by wearing\nvery conservative, nondescript outfits. When they\u2019re told they should\ndress with a litt le more panache, it triggers their anxiety , and  they\nreact with a self-protective hostility . They ha ve poor self-esteem and think they don\u2019 t deserve to look\nnicer . They have an overly rigid self-image and equate dressing even\nslightly dif ferently with giving up everything about who they are. Developing your style\nThis sub section won\u2019 t list a bu nch of rudimentary fashion and grooming\ntips like  \u201cbrush your teeth every  day\u201d, \u201cwear clothes that fit you well\u201d, or\n\u201cregardless of your body type , you\u2019ll look better if you\u2019re fit.\u201d If you\npreviously didn\u2019 t give much tho ught to your hygiene or style, once you\u2019re\ntuned in  to it it\u2019 s easy enough to  look up guides on those topics and figure\nout what to adju st. This chapter is also not going to give you any specific\nclothing suggestions, because what\u2019 s considered good style varies\nimmensely depe nding on your a ge, subculture, and the region o f the world\nyou\u2019re l iving in. Instead, here are some general guidelines on improving\nyour style on your own:\nDon\u2019t feel you have to become  a fashion connoisseur to imp r ove\nyour look. There are advantages to havin g above-average dress\nsense, but it takes time and ef fort to get to that point, and the typical\nperson isn\u2019 t going to think less of you if you don\u2019 t look like you\nstepped of f a fas hion runway . Y ou just need to dress on par wit h theother people in your city . That d oesn\u2019 t mean you have to mind lessly\nadopt th e same uniform as them. Y ou just need an average lev el of\nfashion knowledge. Y ou can \u2019t develop a better sen se of style in a week. Y ou\u2019ll improve\nyour instincts little by little as you read up on the topic, observe  how\nother people dress, experiment with your own look, and get feedback\nfrom the people in your life ab out what suits you best. Practically ,\nthis mea ns don\u2019 t go out tomorrow and spend a bunch of money  in an\nattempt to overhaul your wardrobe. Learn and buy a little at a time. Changing you r look, even for the better , may make you\nuncomfortable. As you \u2019re trying on new clothes, you may think\nthings like, \u201cThat\u2019 s not me. I\u2019m not the type of person who wear s this\nstuf f.\u201d When you first wear a n ew type of outfit, you may feel like\neveryone on the street notices h ow weird and dif ferent you look. T ry\nto push your comfort zone. Y ou may be surprised at how , within a\nfew days, you\u2019ll feel comfortable in outfits that initially made you\nfeel like you were playing dress-up. Fashion-savvy friends can help you tweak your look, but any one\nperson can be h it-or -miss, because their sense of what looks good\nmay no t match  yours.

(An exception is Chapter 13, \u201cCreative Problem Solving,\u201d which deviates a bit from this format in a creative style all its own.)\nYou may notice a crossover effect with some coping stra t-\negies; that is, some designed speci\ufb01  cally to deal with the \ncauses of stress also seem to promote the relaxation response.

Sometimes\nthey\u2019re just as rewarding if they stay at a light-hearted, superficial level. This chapter covers various ways conversations can feel \u201cdeeper\u201d\u2014by\nmoving past small talk, connecting, opening up to each other , and\ndiscussing more intellectual top ics. When you are able to comfortably have\ndeeper , more intimate conversations, your interactions with people can\nbecome even more rewarding. M o v i n g  p a s t  s m a l l  t a l k\nWhen yo u\u2019re first talking to som eone, you\u2019ll often cover general, well-worn\ntopics like your career and education. Asking and answering common\nquestions sometimes has a rote, uninspired feeling to it. This is one type of\nthe dreaded small talk that many  people say they dislike. In a perfect world,\nwe\u2019d never have to do it, but small talk serves some purposes:\nRoutine questio ns are a reliable way to get a conversation going.They let each pe rson cast around for a subject that\u2019 s more eng aging\nfor both  of them. A few lines of  questioning may be repetitive and go\nnowhere, but the next one might be interesting. Standard chitchat helps ease your nerves when you\u2019re most likely to\nfeel anxious. It gives you some safe, predictable, low-mental-ener gy\ntopics to draw on. Small ta lk gives you a platform to show what kind of person you are,\naside from the things you like to discuss. As you spend a few minutes\ncovering familiar ground with someone, you can demonstrate that\nyou\u2019re warm, confident, and glad to talk to them. Many pe ople expect to start a conversation with some neutral small\ntalk, so if you try too hard to barrel past it, you may seem like you\nlack social savvy . Whether a conversation feels lik e small talk also depends on its context. If\nyou\u2019re i nterested in getting to know someone, you usually won\u2019 t have a\nproblem telling them about wha t you do for work or where you grew up. However , if you\u2019re sure the relationship is never going to go any where, like\nif you\u2019re talking to a stranger in  line at the bank, then the same topics can\nfeel forced and like you\u2019re pointlessly going through the motions. Y ou\u2019ll\nalso tend to lose  patience with any topic that comes up over an d over in a\nshort tim e (for example, being asked what you\u2019re taking in college during a\nfamily reunion). T alking about unexciting, trivial topics\nThe term  \u201csmall talk\u201d also refe rs to conversations about mundane, trivial\ntopics like the weather , often with someone you already kn ow , at least\ncasually . Many people aren\u2019 t enthusiastic about this either and wish they\ncould go into deeper , more meaningful subjects. This type of small talk alsohas some justifications:\nIt allows you to socialize with people for its own sake, show your\ninterest in them, and maintain your relationship. Often it lets you  exchange pleasantries in situations where you don\u2019 t\nhave time to ha ve a more intense conversation or the environ ment\nisn\u2019 t con ducive to it. If you run into a coworker in the parking lot,\nyou wan t to acknowledge them and show you\u2019re friendly , but you\nmay hav e only a minute before you have to head home. Some quick\ntalk about the local news is better than nothing. It can keep relationships primed for more substantial socializing\ndown th e road. Maybe you make small talk with a neighbor in  your\ndorm when you run into each ot her while getting your mail.

First, according to Steve Allen, Jr. (1990), \u201cHumor is a physical release, one of four, actually. These include crying, yawn-ing, orgasm, and laughter. You can do them in succes-sion, just get the order right.\u201d Where appropriate, I have included anonymously credited jokes from Novak and Waldok\u2019s Big Book of American Humor (1990) to illustrate \nthese theories. Superiority Theory\nSuperiority theory, thought to be originated by Plato dur-ing the fourth century b.c., is the oldest theory attempting to explain people\u2019s af\ufb01  nity for the ridiculous. When laughter occurs at the expense of someone else, as in mockery or ridicule, so that the end result is that the jokester feels better than the object of ridicule, then the reason for laughter illustrates superiority theory (Box 12.1).

Y ou know they may not be fre e right then, so it doesn\u2019 t sting as much if\nthey say no. Examples of inviting a gr oup to hang out\nThe group of people you\u2019re inviting out could know each other well\nalready , and you\u2019re trying to join their clique. Or everyone could be fairlynew to each other , and you\u2019re t rying to turn them into a new s ocial circle. Inviting a group out is similar to asking a single person to do something. Some people find trying to or ganize a group event less scary , because if it\ndoesn\u2019 t work out, the rejection is more dif fused. It feels like the  suggestion\nitself fiz zled, rather than one p erson specifically declining to spend time\nwith you . Everyone wasn\u2019 t just turning you down either; they were also\nsaying they didn\u2019 t want to spen d time with the whole group (you can even\nphrase in vitations as \u201cW e\u2019re doing X. W ant to come?\u201d). Alternatively , some\npeople find extending an invita tion to a group more stressful , because if\ntheir sug gestion goes nowhere, they feel like a whole bunch of people are\npassing judgment on them.

When you invite one person out, they either say\nyes or no. If the y say yes, then  you only need to figure out t he specifics\nwith the m. Whe n you invite a group, more work goes into getting the plan\nfleshed out. Some people may say yes, some might say no. The plan may go\nthrough a few dif ferent permutations before everyone agrees on it. Inviting one or mor e people to do something with your existing friends\nWhen groups are involved, yo u can invite a potential new friend to do\nsomething with your current group of friends. \u201cMy friends and I are going out on Saturday . W ant to join us if you\u2019re\nfree?\u201d\n\u201cMy buddies and I get together every T uesday evening to play poker . Y ou should come out one week.\u201d\nIf yo u don\u2019 t ha ve much of an existing social circle, you can \u2019 t do this. However , if you have this option, it\u2019 s probably the lowest-sta kes way to\nextend an invitation. Y ou\u2019re n ot inviting someone from a position of\nneediness. Y ou\u2019re of fering a social opportunity . If they say no, you can still\nhang out with your other friends. What if you invite someone out and they turn you down?If someo ne turn s you down, yo u may get confused because y ou may not\nknow where you stand with th em. Most people find it uncom fortable to\ndirectly tell someone they\u2019re not  keen on hanging out. They also don\u2019 t want\nto make future interactions aw kward by directly rejecting you. Instead,\nthey\u2019ll make excuses, \u201cfor get\u201d to reply to your written invitation, or vaguely\nagree that maybe the two of you could do something some tim e, but never\nfollow up. Of c ourse, these things could also just mean they\u2019re genuinely\nbusy . How many times should you ask someone to hang out befor e giving up? Three ti mes, maybe four if the  invitations are spread out. Y o u can ask a\nsecond t ime fair ly soon, and if they say no again, give them some space\nbefore tr ying on ce or twice mor e. If you haven\u2019 t gotten togethe r after that,\nthey\u2019re e ither po litely brushing you of f, or they\u2019ve shown they\u2019re too busy\nto have new fr iends. On occasion, someone will genuinely want to be\nfriends with you, but their life is hectic and they have to turn  down your\ninvitations for legitimate reasons. However , after three rejected invites with\nno e f fort on th eir part to arran ge something, it\u2019 s likely they just aren\u2019 t\ninterested, and it\u2019 s better to put your ener gy elsewhere. The exc eption to this guideline i s when you\u2019re extending low-ef fort group\nactivity invitatio ns to someone you\u2019re on good terms with and who comes\nto your get-toge thers, but only o ccasionally because they have hectic lives. In that case, it\u2019 s fine to tell them, \u201cW e\u2019re all hanging out at  T ina\u2019 s this\nFriday\u201d for several weeks in a  row without them attending because you\nknow they will show up every now and then. T ry to set up r ecurring plans\nUsually once you\u2019ve hung out  with a person or group, you have to go\nthrough another  round of mak ing plans if you want to see them again.That\u2019 s hardly a terrible amount of work, but it can make you feel like your\nsocial life is uncertain from week to week. Y ou could try to set up a\nrecurring plan, like watching a m ovie at someone\u2019 s place every W ednesday\nnight or  going out for dinner on ce a month. Often everyone is too busy to\nestablish an ongoing arrangement, but it\u2019 s great when you can set up these\nreliable social activities for yo urself. These arrangements take work to\nmaintain, so don\u2019 t take them for granted.

But whe n it comes to hearing about plans made by\nother people\u2026\nDo your best to accept every invitation\nIf you\u2019re  trying to get your social life of f the ground and som eone invites\nyou to do something, do your best to go. Why turn down a chance to get outthere? After you have more frien ds and invitations competing for your time,\nyou can be cho osier . If you\u2019re more of an anxious or solitary person, it\u2019 s\neasy to overthin k an invitation and come up with reasons why it won\u2019 t be\nfun. T ry to work  past those wor ries and go anyway . Y ou can never be sure\nhow enjoyable something will be until you show up and see for yourself. Sometimes you\u2019 ll have to inconvenience yourself for the sake of your\nsocial life. Y ou m ay get invited to a movie you\u2019re not particularly excited to\nsee or be asked at the last minute to a party on a cold, rainy Friday night\nwhen yo u were planning to go t o bed early . Again, being in a s ocial setting\noutweighs these minor annoyances. Most people will stop inviting you out if you decline too often. They may\nhave no thing against you, but the next time they\u2019re planning an event,\nthey\u2019ll t hink, \u201cT hey\u2019ve never come when I\u2019ve asked before, so  no point in\nletting th em kno w this time.\u201d If  you\u2019re interested in an invitati on but can\u2019 t\nattend for legitimate reasons, m ake it clear to the inviter you want to hang\nout with  them and would if yo u could. The best way to show that is to\nextend an invitation of your own fairly soon after . Figur e out what other people\u2019 s plans ar e and then hop on board\nMany pe ople consistently have things to do with their friends because they\nregularly ask around to see what  everyone is up to. They don\u2019 t tr y to initiate\ntheir own plan every single wee k. If they want to go out on the weekend,\nthey\u2019ll s tart ping ing their social circle around Thursday and ask what their\nplans ar e for Friday night and the weekend. If they hear som ething they\nlike, they\u2019ll get on board. If no one has solid plans yet, but som e people are\ninterested in doing something, the \u201casking around\u201d conversation  provides a\nstarting point for figuring out w hat they could do together (for example,\n\u201cW e could have a barbecue at t he park like Mor gan was talkin g about the\nother da y\u201d). Al so, asking around is a good way to take initi ative, showyou\u2019re interested in spending time with people, and generally stay on a\ngroup\u2019 s radar . Inviting yourself to social events\nA tricky aspect of getting on board with other people\u2019 s plans is inviting\nyourself to a ge t-together when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019d be w elcome. The key  thing to know is that o n occasion it is okay to invite y ourself. Sometimes you won\u2019 t get an invitation, but if you ask if you can come\nalong, everyone  will be fine with it. In the end, you\u2019ll have to use your\njudgment about whether you sh ould try for an invite, but here a re some\nbroad guidelines:\nWhen you ask if you can come, always speak in a casual, non-\npressuring way (for example, \u201cY ou\u2019re going to a party tomorrow ?

But Sheila\u2019s \ninterpretation may be that Mark is passing judgment on her health habits, making her quite angry. From Tannen\u2019s research, she has come to the conclusion that people\u2014or Americans, at least\u2014tend to be indirect rather than direct in the messages they communicate, whether out of politeness, fear, or manipulation. This indirectness is a precursor to perceived stress, and greatly compromises the effectiveness of communication, lead-ing to further misunderstanding and potential con\ufb02  ict. Verbal communication is one way to get a message across, but by no means the only way. Metamessages also are stated indirectly through postures, clothes, and facial expressions. Thus, communication is basically catego-rized as verbal and nonverbal. Verbal Communication\nVerbal language is a series of expressive thoughts and perceptions described through word symbols. Linguistic experts divide verbal communication into two compo-nents: encoding and decoding. Encoding is the process wherein a speaker attempts to frame thoughts and per-ceptions into words (e.g., someone saying to the person next to her, \u201cBoy, it\u2019s stuffy in here\u201d). Decoding is the \nprocess wherein the message is translated, dissected, analyzed, and interpreted by the listener (e.g., the per-son hearing this thinks, \u201cYeah, the room does smell rather gamey\u201d). Misunderstanding, confusion, and stress can arise anywhere in this process.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

In the course of asserting yourself, you may \ufb01  nd that others may consciously \nor unconsciously try to block your efforts to accomplish resolution. The following are some roadblocks of manipulation to be aware of, as well as some suggested strategies that may help to dismantle them:\na. Intimidation. Asserting yourself may intimi-\ndate others who are in the habit of using ma-\nnipulation and control to get their way. They in turn may raise their voices and display their tempers. When you recognize this behavior, you can defuse it by saying that you want to hold off further discussion of this issue until the other person calms down. For example, \u201cI can see that you are quite angry; let\u2019s talk about this after lunch.\u201d\nb. Content substitution. Sometimes people will \ndraw peripheral issues into a discussion to derail the issue at hand. If you become aware that the concern you brought up has become lost in tangential issues, quickly shift focus back to the original topic until your issue has been put to rest. c. Personal attacks (character assassination). You \nmay \ufb01  nd that in an attempt to resolve an issue, \nthe person you are talking to comes back at you with a character \ufb02\n aw. One way to get \nback on track is to agree, in part, about the character \ufb02  aw and ignore the rest. Davis calls this response clouding, the attempt to de\ufb02  ect \nan attack by concurring with some part of it. When employing this technique, rephrase the attack in your best interest, and get back to the issue at hand.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Choose the best alternative.

The story began in 1984, when their son, Lorenzo, then \n6 years old, was sent home from school for displaying hyperactive behavior. As days turned into months, addi-tional symptoms appeared, and eventually Lorenzo was diagnosed with the newly named and little understood adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a lethal genetic disease of dysfunctional nerve tissue, resulting from an extremely high number of very long fatty-acid chains in the blood. Lorenzo was given a maximum of 2 years to live. But his parents did not accept Lorenzo\u2019s death sentence. Upon learning of the prognosis for their son, they took turns going to the National Library of Medicine to research ALD and staying home to care for Lorenzo. With persistence, willpower, luck, and what Augusto \ncalls a \u201cwhole lot of love,\u201d their search for clues not only enlightened the medical community about the dynamics involved in the etiology of the disease, but led to the creation of a medication, Lorenzo\u2019s Oil, which arrested the progression of the disease. Lorenzo\u2019s Oil is now used to treat this disease in children all over the world. A lawyer for the World Bank, Augusto has earned an hon-\norary doctorate in medicine for his achievement.

Art therapy for Vietnam veterans has proved so successful that in 1981 an art museum in Chicago was established for Vietnam vets to exhibit their work. Efforts have been made with similar art therapy programs involving Iraq war veterans, as noted by Washington Post reporter Jackie Spinner (2007). The treatment of self-mutilation and eating disorders, \nparticularly anorexia nervosa, has also included art therapy as a part of the process. In these conditions, the patient often feels helpless to control his or her existing environment and identity. Perceptions of stress are turned inward and manifested through a process of slow physical self-destruction. Inner con\ufb02  icts regarding \ncontrol issues are manifested through signi\ufb01  cant weight \nloss, which is paralleled by a distorted body image. In a study conducted at Goldsmiths College employing art therapy with anorexics (Levick, 1983), it was noted that the subjects rarely drew human \ufb01  gures. When they were drawn, however, they showed adolescent charac-teristics suggesting a denial of adult responsibilities and physical maturation. Paintings and sketches by patients often depicted images of isolation and loneliness; in one case, a subject drew herself as a cactus. Progress was noted when subjects began to represent their true physi-cal conditions\u2014that is, they drew themselves in human form. Art as a means of self-expression by anorexic patients was perceived to help increase self-awareness by opening the lines of communication within the indi-vidual, thus acknowledging strengths and weaknesses, and an increased comfort with both. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, \nwhen schools reopened in New York City (and even other districts nationwide), students were invited to share their level of stress by drawing their thoughts, feelings, and images on paper as a cathartic exercise to relieve emotional suffering, much of which could not be articulated by words alone (Flatow, 2002). School teach-ers in and around military bases are known to often use art therapy with grade-school and middle-school chil-dren during military con\ufb02  icts (e.g., the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the Iraq war in 2003). Students are asked to draw their feelings regarding the respective wars and their parents\u2019 involvement. Typically, the drawings reveal fears of abandonment, detachment, sorrow, and loneliness. The bottom line is that every-one, regardless of their personal experiences, can bene\ufb01  t \nfrom art therapy. Just as much can be revealed by a picture, much can also \nbe revealed by casual doodles, the kind that accompany lecture notes, decorate grocery lists, or are scribbled on paper napkins (\nFIG. 11.6  /H17076). Psychologist Robert \nBurns has researched the meanings of doodles only to \ufb01 nd that they are another form of art therapy. Doodles \nare nonverbal messages that surface from the uncon-scious mind, each doodle or mark important in its own right. Often, doodles are symbols of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions in visual form. Although the under-standing of \u201cdoodling\u201d is in its infancy, several observa-tions have been made by Burns (Jaret, 1991). Aggression is often expressed in dark, heavy, jagged lines with arrows or points. Horizontal lines convey inner peace. Happiness is typically represented by soft, curvy lines. Burns discov-ered that men typically draw geometric shapes\u2014squares, triangles, circles\u2014whereas women tend to sketch faces. Like the conscious effort to draw a graphic representa-Chapter 11\n250\nDoodles may not seem like a form \nof therapy, but they, too, reveal \nwhat cannot be expressed verbally.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Your wallet, your marriage, and all aspects of your life will thank you. The Hands of Time\nThe constru cts of seconds, hours, days, months, and \nyears are creations of the human mind. It is believed that the concept of time was originally created to master the natural environment, particularly the position of the sun over the earth and the change of seasons. The Babylonians are credited with the \ufb01  rst 360-day calen-dar, comprised of 12 lunar months, each with 30 days. In due time, 5 days were added to the year by the Egyptians to compensate for rotational differences between the earth and moon. Additional changes were made by the early Romans, and again by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, who devised the contemporary, or Gregorian, calendar. On a smaller but no less important scale, the \ufb01  rst mechanical clock is credited to an elev-enth-century Chinese man, Su Song. Two more centu-ries would pass before a similar machine would appear in the Western world, a clock constructed of iron gears and weights built for an English monastery. The pen-dulum clock arrived 300 years later, through the cre-ativity of a Dutch scientist, Christian Huygens. Pocket watches were in vogue at the turn of the twentieth cen-tury until the invention of the wrist watch. With the advent of high technology, time is now measured in nanoseconds through the use of quartz crystals and dig-ital displays (O\u2019Connor and Robertson, 2002). As civilizations developed and technology was shared \namong cultures, awareness and utilization of time con-tributed to the organization and advancement of the human race, and hence became accepted ways to make order out of chaos. Time became a tool used by various societies to unite and synchronize the efforts of individ-uals in their communities. American time zones (Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Paci\ufb01  c), for example, were created by railroad companies to synchronize their schedules over various parts of the country, and were eventually adopted by the United States government in 1883. Global time zones followed suit in 1884 (Boslough, 1990). Once conceived, time has been manipulated constantly. The international dateline, daylight savings time, and leap year are three examples of attempts to re\ufb01  ne and \nmanipulate the basic constructs of time. The 8-hour workday is another. In an attempt to harness time and manipulate it for gain and pleasure, however, citizens of the industrialized world have often found themselves to be slaves to the concept rather than masters of it. The result: Time, or the lack thereof, is now considered to be a premier stressor in the lives of many people. And although time is not considered a precursor to disease and illness in itself, a rushed lifestyle, or as psychologist Robert Levine (1989) calls it, \u201cclockwork blues,\u201d which constantly disrupts the body\u2019s biological clock, is now associated with the incidence of coronary heart disease, ulcers, and other stress-related illnesses. Perhaps not surprisingly, more people have heart attacks on Monday mornings than on any other day of the week. Looking busy might be considered a status symbol to \nsome people, but not to Stephan Rechtschaffen, M.D. In his highly acclaimed book Time Shifting , Rechtschaffen \nexplains that being overproductive is an index of stress, a fast-paced rhythm that leads to dysfunction. Rechtschaffen says that the rhythm of society itself is increasing, and many people are unaware they are caught up in it. People are entrained by the rhythm of their working environment in what he calls hyperpro-ductivity. The short-term gains may seem impressive.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>If you don\u2019 t, the tec hniques will be a waste of time or become\nunhealthy habits.

This conscious inhibition of\n \nemotional expression, coupled with the unconscious sup-pression of perceptions, attitudes, and feelings, may even-tually result in neurotic (worrisome) behavior or the manifestation of physical symptoms. The results can be devastating, perhaps leading one to several visits to a psy-chologist. One of the primary goals of psychotherapy is to nurture self-awareness and honest self-expression. In the short term, self-expression through journal writ-\ning may serve as an emotional catharsis by getting out on paper the toxic thoughts roaming through one\u2019s head. Journal writing allows the release of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions that liberates the mind and softens or expands the walls of the ego. Journal writing has often been called a writing meditation because as old thoughts are permitted to leave, the empty space they once occupied allows for expanded awareness of one\u2019s internal landscape as well as expanded depth of thought. This expanded awareness is analogous to a panoramic view from a mountaintop compared to an obstructed view from the base. Increased awareness opens the door for increased understanding of ourselves in our many environments. Writing down personal thoughts gives one permission to let them go, no longer thinking about them with the intensity that may have cluttered the mind and drained energy. Release of thoughts and feelings may also act as a personal confes-sion, an honest confrontation of one\u2019s behaviors. And this is an initial step toward healing both one\u2019s internal relationship and personal relationships with others. In addition, unlike conversation or internal dialogue, use of writing as a channel of self-expression makes the writer accountable for, or allows the writer to take solid ownership of, feelings as abstract thoughts become tan-gible on paper.

The story began in 1984, when their son, Lorenzo, then \n6 years old, was sent home from school for displaying hyperactive behavior. As days turned into months, addi-tional symptoms appeared, and eventually Lorenzo was diagnosed with the newly named and little understood adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a lethal genetic disease of dysfunctional nerve tissue, resulting from an extremely high number of very long fatty-acid chains in the blood. Lorenzo was given a maximum of 2 years to live. But his parents did not accept Lorenzo\u2019s death sentence.

With persistence, willpower, luck, and what Augusto \ncalls a \u201cwhole lot of love,\u201d their search for clues not only enlightened the medical community about the dynamics involved in the etiology of the disease, but led to the creation of a medication, Lorenzo\u2019s Oil, which arrested the progression of the disease.

Changing factors in your environment might include driving a different route to work or blocking out time periods during the day dur-ing which you do not answer the phone so as to get a major task completed. In situations where you change speci\ufb01  c factors, you attempt to manipulate or control \nyour environment so that your encounters with poten-tial stressors are minimal. To change your environment means relocating from unhealthy or intolerable living conditions to a new setting that is conducive to better health status. Because changing one\u2019s environment is both costly and time consuming, this approach is often used as a last resort. Keep in mind that if you choose to change your environment so as to avoid people or run away, then this coping technique is being used improp-erly and no resolution is guaranteed. Also, recall from Chapter 1 that Holmes and Rahe found that relocating to a new environment is a stressful experience in itself. On a larger scale, social orchestration can be seen in many \npolitical grass-roots efforts\u2014lobbying Congress to pass legislation favoring particular issues and concerns, for example. In fact, social o rchestration is the coping skill of \nchoice at both local and national governmental levels for issues such as land\ufb01  lls and recycling. On a smaller scale, social o rchestration is a strategy we employ regularly with \npersonal chores and responsibilities, but it is an effective one in the management of major life stressors. A prime example of social orchestration where factors in \nthe environment were changed for all Americans was the fallout from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In Manhattan, commuter train routes were disrupted for months, as were some roads and highways leading into the city, which changed going to and coming home from work into a challenge. Many people learned to telecom-mute and actually found they preferred this style of work. Many businesses whose locations were either devastated in the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings or closed because of smoke and falling ash needed to open temporary of\ufb01  ces in outlying areas. Perhaps one of the biggest changes that affected the U.S. population related to air travel, when new security checks required addi-tional hours of time before take-off, readjusting time schedules for everyone involved.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>First, only a handful of people (3 percent) wrote every day in their journals, and while more women than men kept jour-nals, the difference was not signi\ufb01  cant. Second, journal \nentries were centered less on emotions than on facts to describe speci\ufb01  c events, a style that may not have been as bene\ufb01  cial an experience as perceived by the journal \nwriter. Last, he found that journal writers seemed to fall into two distinct categories. The \ufb01  rst group tended to \nwrite only during periods of mental frustration and monumental stress. The journal became a sounding board and tended to carry the burden of anxieties. The second group wrote nearly every day; however, when a major stressor arose (e.g., death of a spouse, career stress), a time when writing might be the most help, a safe dis-tance was kept from the journal and no writing took place. Pennebaker noted a third group of people, though, who instead of keeping a journal, wrote letters. Although this may seem similar to journal entries, letters are often less than candid about internal feelings about oneself to oneself. In my work with clients, I have also noticed a fourth group: people who do not necessarily write fre-quently, perhaps once or twice a week, but whose jour-nal entries tend to be balanced between positive and negative experiences. The positive experiences are more factual, and perhaps even integrated into a creative story. The narratives of negative experiences include inner feelings to describe the reasons for these emotions. Journal Writing Styles, Themes, and Ideas\nWhereas journal entries can consist of a daily report on personal events, they can also be inspired by speci\ufb01  c \nthemes that surface and merit exploration to give the writer a new vantage point on him- or herself. Examples include dreams, rites of passage, values assessment and clari\ufb01  cation, unwritten letters, self-esteem issues, free \nthought relationships, things to do, wish lists, creative story writing, poems, or any topic the writer chooses to expound upon. Themes can also be conveyed in many styles of writing, including linear (left to right), circular (rotating the paper as you write), in boxes, and free-form. Three of these are as follows:Thoughts\nI gotta\nget thatpaperfinishedby Friday.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>As we all know, this is not always the case. Use technology to simplify, not complicate, your life. In attempting to be more ef\ufb01  cient, the human mind \ntends to break down and compartmentalize entities, such as time, into smaller parts to better comprehend and manipulate them. Neurophysiologists who have studied right- and left-brain cognitive functions have observed that the right hemisphere has no concept of time, and they therefore agree that time awareness is clearly a left-brain function. Yet imagination and spa-tial awareness have been found to be crucial factors in the effective utilization of time. So, it would be wise to assume that the effective management of time involves the cognitive functions of both cerebral hemispheres. Time management can be de\ufb01  ned as the ability to priori-\ntize, schedule, and execute personal responsibilities to personal satisfaction. Time management is a relatively new concept in both personal and professional develop-ment. Corporations that desire greater productivity invest their own time and money in creative consultants to train and educate their employees to manage time more ef\ufb01  -\nciently. The following are some of the lessons they teach. Roadblocks to Effective \nTime Management\nBefore one can begin to employ strategies for the more \nef\ufb01 cient use of time, several roadblocks must be over-\ncome. With a greater awareness of pertinent attitudes, issues, and concerns, the ability to employ time-man-agement skills, without becoming stressed in the pro-cess, will become a strong coping strategy when needed. There are many reasons for mismanaged time, includ-ing attitudes about oneself and one\u2019s working environ-ment or organization, personality styles, values, and lack of knowledge about time-management skills. The most prevalent of these are attitudes and their asso-\nciated behaviors.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "4.

In the early days of American \nvaudeville, many actors used physical farce to gen-erate laughs (\nFIG. 12.2  /H17073). Slipping on a banana \npeel, getting a pie in the face, or reeling from a slap on the cheek was sure to get a rise out of the audi-ence. While banana peels and cream pies were real, face slaps were faked. Behind the curtain stood a person making the sound effects. Originating in the French theater, the slap stick was a piece of leather nailed to a \ufb02  at board. At the appropriate moment on stage, use of the slap stick would also produce laughs.

The chapter ends with some tips on how you can practice\nreading nonverbal cues. If you\u2019d like to know more, the Further Reading\nsection suggests some more in-depth books on the subject.

However , reading nonverbal signals will never\nlet you completely scan someone\u2019 s mind. T uning in to th is type of\ncommunication is not fully reliable for a number of reasons:\nPeople know how to control an d disguise the nonverbal signals they\nsend in order to be polite. F or example, they\u2019ll put a friendly\nattentive look on their face, even though they\u2019re not interested in the\ntopic you\u2019re talking about. Som etimes their true intent will leak  out,\nbut they can often hide it successfully . People have dif ferent styles  of communicating nonver bally ,\ndepending on their personality , mood, age, gender , and culture. Some\nare more cheery and animated ; others always seem a bit flat and\ngloomy . Some use common ges tures in idiosyncratic ways. If you\u2019ve\njust met someone, you can\u2019 t fully know what their nonverbal signals\nare telling you. A lot of nonver bal communicat ion is quick and subtle. Most of the\ntime, people don\u2019 t feel the int ense emotions that lead to ob vious\nunspoken signals. For example , if you say something that mildly\nsurprises them, their eyes may just go slightly wide for a split second. They won\u2019 t do a cartoonish double take. Outside forces can interfere wit h the signals people would normally\nsend. For example, if they find  the room chilly , they might comeacross as more tense and closed of f because they\u2019re distracted and\nhunching up to try to keep warm. All i n al l, you should try to glean what information you can from people\u2019 s\nnonverbal messa ges. At the sam e time, know you\u2019ll never hav e a perfect\nunderstanding of what they\u2019re thinking, so you should focus on going after\nyour own social goals. For instance, if you want to talk to someone in your\nclass but you can\u2019 t tell if they\u2019re in the mood to chat, give it a s hot and see\nwhat happens.

Before the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was a productive society, the vast major-ity of its citizens making more than 70 percent of their household items themselves. As the country became a consumer society, however, more and more items were bought rather than made at home. The availability of several new inventions, like the washer and dryer, pro-vided more leisure time. But with some of these inven-tions, lifestyles became very comfortable, and our collective creative skills became dull (Mander, 1978; Jackson, 2004).

People now take a passive role in the creative process, letting other people do the important, creative thinking. Experts agree that a happy mind is a creative mind.

Y ou\u2019ll still go through the sam e kinds of\ntreatment appro aches the following chapters cover , but a pro fessional or\nothers with similar issues can s upport you through the rough patches and\ncustomize everything to your needs.

Medication dampens the physical symptoms of anxiety ,\nbut doesn\u2019 t af fect its underlying psychological causes.

Although many people take me dication on a short-term basis, a smaller\nnumber feel it im proves their quality of life enough to justify staying on it\nlong-term. They realize that they were born with an overly high anxiety\nlevel, and medication brings it down to a level where they can functionbetter . Some people are justifiably wary about taking any kind of drug, and it\u2019 s\nnot a decision to be made lightly . Medication can cause side ef fects, and it\ncan take  people some time and e xperimentation before they find  a drug and\ndosage that works for them. In more severe cases, it can make the\ndif ference though, so at least give it some thought if a professional makes\nthat recommendation.5\nH a n d l i n g  C o u n t e r p r o d u c t i v e  T h i n k i n g  a b o u t\nS o c i a l i z i n g\nS HYNESS , SOCIAL  ANXIETY , INSECURITIES , AND  DISCOURAGEMENT  about your\nchances of improving are all sustained in part by thoughts and beliefs that\nare coun terproductive\u2014that is, thoughts that lead you away from good\noutcomes. They create unpleasant feelings like nervousness and self-doubt,\nand cause you to behave in ways that go against your goa ls, such as\navoiding get-tog ethers or giving up on trying to be friends w ith people. They can pop up  in the present moment or when you\u2019re looking  back on the\npast or toward t he future.

This chapter explains the two broad ways your thinking can stifle you. Then it covers two approaches for dealing with your counterproductive\nthoughts. First, it gives you a fra mework for identifying and disputing these\ntypes of  though ts and replacing them with more-balanced alternatives. It\nthen exp lains an  equally ef fective alternative approach\u2014using mindfulness\nprinciples to acknowledge and accept your counterproductiv e thoughts\nwithout getting sucked into them.

Emotional r easoning\nEmotional reaso ning is when you think that because your e motions are\ntelling y ou something is a certain way , it truly is  that way . For example,\nthinking that because you feel anxious, something must be happening that is\nworth feeling anxious about, when in fact maybe you\u2019re ju st on edge\nbecause you drank too much cof fee.

It\u2019 s good to have several approaches ready to go, and if one\ndoesn\u2019 t w ork, yo u can try anothe r . Y ou can also switch up broad approaches\nwithin a  single conversation as it evolves. Y ou don\u2019 t have to app ly only one\nstrategy to every person or situation. The broad conversation goals th at were covered earlier in the chapter are\none way  to give yourself some direction (\u201cI\u2019m going to ask about their\ninterests and try to find one we have in common,\u201d \u201cMy grandpa is\ninterested to know what I\u2019ve be en up to lately , so I\u2019ll focus on  telling him\nwhat\u2019 s b een new in my life since I last saw him\u201d). Here are some other\napproaches you can use:\nAppr oach #1: Be inter ested in and curious about other people, and\nmake it your goal to find out what\u2019 s fascinating and unique about them\nThis is the most popular general  approach you\u2019ll hear people me ntion when\nit comes to making conversation. It comes up again and again, going back\nto classic books on people skills like How to W in Fr iends and Influence\nPeople . Th e ide a is primarily to be som eone who asks questions and li stens\nto the answers, which leads to focusing the discussion on the other person. Y our \u201cmission\u201d in the convers ation is to discover what makes the other\nperson interesting. Y ou don\u2019 t need to only listen to  or talk about the other person the entire\ntime; yo u should bring up things about yourself and share  your own\nopinions when relevant. Generally focus the conversation on your partner ,\nbut not to the po int where you share nothing about yourself an d become afor gettable nonentity that just helps other people talk. The underlying assumption abou t this approach is that everyone\u2019 s favorite\nsubject is themselves, and that people like someone who take s a genuine\ninterest in them and the things they have to say . People also tend to feel\ngood ab out a conversation in which they can talk about aspects of\nthemselves that they\u2019re proud o f and passionate about. Another line you\u2019ll\noften he ar in regard to this strategy is that you\u2019ll be more succe ssful taking\nan in terest in other people than you will be by trying to get them interested\nin you. This approach predisposes you to adopt a positive, friendly frame of\nmind. It s basic premise implies that everyone is worth talking to if you dig\npast any preconceptions you ma y have of them. And because you\u2019re likely\nto find somethin g interesting about the other person if you look for it, it\nends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy . Appr oach #2: T alk in terms of the other person\u2019 s inter ests\nFocusing on the other person\u2019 s interests is similar to the approach above, in\nthat you\u2019re mainly listening and  the conversation is based around the other\nperson and things they like discussing. This approach is not exactly the\nsame. The approach above is more general and is about finding people\u2019 s\ngood traits, whatever they may be. This one is more about specifically\ntrying to find out what the other person is interested in talking about,\nwhether it\u2019 s a hobby or a life decision they\u2019re wrestling with, and centering\nthe con versation on that. Y ou take an interest in their interest, ask\nthoughtful questions, and listen as they tell you about it.

At the same t ime, their\nef fectiveness is sometimes oversold.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

E m p a t h y  d e f i n e d\nBroadly speakin g, empathy is th e ability to put yourself in another person\u2019 s\nshoes. There are two types:\nEmotional empathy  is the ability to pick up on  other people\u2019 s\nemotions and have an appropriate feeling in response. For example, if\nyour friend gets some upsetting news, you feel sympathetic for them\nand a bit sad yourself. Sometimes people refer to empathy as this\nability t o feel what another pe rson is feeling. At other times what\nthey me an by empathy is act ing on those feelings and sho wing\nconcern and support. Cognitive empathy  is the ability to more logically get inside\nsomeone\u2019 s head and take on the ir perspective. Y ou don\u2019 t necessarily\nfeel what they\u2019re feeling, but yo u can rationally understand how they\nsee the world (f or example, a c ertain book doesn\u2019 t bother you, but\nyou can grasp how it would be of fensive to someone with more\ntraditional values).

Of course, there\u2019 s overlap between the two because you can often use one\nto g ive you info rmation about the other (for example, knowing someone\u2019 s\nworldview and history helps you emotionally empathize with why a certain\nevent makes them so angry).

Trained in Jungian psychology, Progoff discovered that his own journal writ-ing allowed direct access to a higher consciousness or spir-itual awareness, which encouraged the search for meaning in his own life. The fruits of these efforts led him to share this coping technique with others who might bene\ufb01  t from \nit. Journal writing, Progoff suggested, allows for the syn-thesis of personal thoughts, feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and insights toward spiritual growth. In 1966, he estab-lished a seminar, called the Intensive Journal Workshop, in which he trained participants in the art of journal writ-ing for self-improvement. Progoff \u2019s method of journal writing, with its use of a three-ringed notebook divided into twenty-one sections separating various components of one\u2019s thoughts, sought to open doors in the mind through various themes or springboards to self-explora-tion. His sections included Daily Log, Stepping Stones, Time Stretching, Dialogue Dimension, Imagery Extensions, A Personal Autobiography, and Dream Interpretation, as well as a series of personal dialogues on a host of topics, from body awareness to societal expecta-tions. Collectively, these topics provided lessons in mak-ing order out of chaos from the glut of sensory information that is continually processed in the mind. Journal writing, Progoff said, allows the writer to initiate a positive con-frontation with several issues that contribute to the under-standing of one\u2019s personal existence. In an experiment to examine the effects of journal writ-\ning on personal growth, 300 people were recruited from New York City\u2019s welfare and unemployment programs and introduced to the practice through Progoff \u2019s work-shop, in conjunction with a job training program. Within a 12-month period, more than 90 percent of those enrolled in the workshop improved their job sta-tus and housing conditions. Credit for these improve-ments was given to the enhanced state of self-reliance attained through journal writing. As Progoff states in his book At a Journal Workshop , journal writing \u201cplays \nan active role in reconstructing a life, but it does so with-out imposing any external categories or interpretations or theories of the individual\u2019s experience. It remains neutral and open-ended so as to maintain the integrity of each person\u2019s development, while drawing him fur-ther along the road of his own life process.\u201d He refers to journal writing as transpsychological, a word describ-\ning the therapeutic effects of self-discovery through active awareness, which allows the individual to access personal resources and promotes wholeness. The Intensive Journal Workshop offered a very orga-\nnized method to journal writing, yet some people felt it lacked the spontaneity and freedom that make self-expression through journal writing unique. The cur-rent approach to journal writing, advocated by journal therapist Kathleen Adams, is called humanistic journal therapy, where journal writing is a vehicle for the devel-opment and maintenance of the transpersonal self or the bonding between oneself and one\u2019s enlightened self. In Jungian psychology, the transpersonal self would be described as a union of the conscious and unconscious minds through communication of words, symbols, and dreams to enhance human potential. In the past 20 to 30 years, journal writing has often been \ncombined with other coping techniques for personal growth.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Dry humor, quick wit, and puns.

Rather\nthan quickly replying that your weekend was fun, mention something you\ndid. Let your in terests, values, and personality show . Y ou won\u2019 t always\nknow w hat to say , and it\u2019 s fine if you sometimes have to give short, sparse\nanswers. However , if you give too many , it puts too much pressure on the\nother person to keep the interac tion alive. This isn\u2019 t to say you need to goon f or a  full minute every time it\u2019 s your turn to speak. Y ou can  of fer your\npartner plenty of jumping-of f points in a meaningful sentence or two. Mini-questions, statements, or facial expr essions that encourage the\nother person to keep talking\nIf the person is  talking about something they\u2019re interested in , you don\u2019 t\nnecessarily have to come up wit h an elaborate reply when they pause to let\nyou speak. Y ou may just need to make a quick little utterance that tells\nthem, \u201cI \u2019m listen ing. Keep going,\u201d or \u201cHere\u2019 s my reaction to what you just\nsaid. Co ntinue.\u201d Some example s are \u201cHm\u201d, \u201cUh huh\u2026 uh huh\u2026\u201d, \u201cOh\nyeah?\u201d, \u201cGo on\u2026\u201d, \u201cHa ha, no way\u2026\u201d, \u201cY ep, that\u2019 s somethin g he\u2019d do.\u201d\nSometimes you don\u2019 t even have to speak; you can just laugh, look sad, or\nlook surprised at the appropriate moment and let the person continue what\nthey were saying. Mixing up questions and statements\nIn most conversations, you\u2019ll want to use a mix of questions and statements. If you ask someone question after question, it can create an i nterview or\ninterrogation dy namic or cause a lopsided exchange where one person feels\nthey\u2019re d oing al l of the sharing about themselves while the othe r remains a\ncipher . S haring too many of you r own statements may make yo u seem like\nyou\u2019re n ot interested in the other person and their opinions, and simply\nwant someone to talk at. Even if your responses have substance,  if you only\nanswer another person\u2019 s questio ns but never ask any of your own, it can put\ntoo m uch pressure on them to ke ep driving the interaction forward. That too\ncan make you seem like you\u2019re indif ferent to learning anything about them. Some types of discussions w ill naturally feature more questions or\nstatements. If you\u2019re talking to someone about a mutual interest , you\u2019ll tend\nto m ake a lot of statements to each other as you share your opinions andinformation. If you\u2019re getting t o know someone or listening and helping\nthem work through a tricky is sue, you may mostly be asking questions\nwhen it\u2019 s your turn to speak.

H owever , if you pay att ention to what the other person  says, their\nstatements can give you a lot of  ideas. For example, if someone says, \u201cMy\nweekend at the cottage was fun. I went jet skiing for the first time,\u201d some\npossible jumping of f points are:\nW eekend:  T alk  about how  your own weekend was. \u201cOh, that sounds\nfun.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

Another topic common to journal \nwriters is called \u201cunsent letters.\u201d One type of res-olution people tend to avoid like the plague is rifts occurring in relationships of any kind. The hard-est rift to resolve occurs when a friend or loved one dies without your getting the chance to say goodbye. Kathleen Adams (1990) states that unsent letters provide the opportunity for \u201cthe three C\u2019s\u201d: catharsis, clarity, and completion. As a cathartic tool, the drafting of an unsent letter allows release of suppressed emotions including grief, anger, or guilt. For this journal technique to prove effective, it is a given that the letter does not go in the mail so that emotions can bubble up freely and surface without fear of self-censorship or reprisal. We all carry excess emotional baggage from unresolved relationships. The drafting of unsent letters allows us to lighten our emotional load. Clarity becomes evident when the writer realizes there is no chance for rebuttal from the addressee. Under this circumstance, you can be as direct as you wish and state exactly how you feel and why you feel this way. Although writing a \n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   23956147_CH10_229_243.indd   239 9/29/08   11:07:16 PM9/29/08   11:07:16 PMChapter 10\nletter to someone you need to communicate with \ndoes not resolve all issues, it does begin to bring \nthe unresolved issues to closure. A variation on this journal technique is to write down thoughts of anger and hostility and then crumple up the paper and throw it away. The crumpling adds to the emotional catharsis.

It\u2019 s good to have several approaches ready to go, and if one\ndoesn\u2019 t w ork, yo u can try anothe r . Y ou can also switch up broad approaches\nwithin a  single conversation as it evolves. Y ou don\u2019 t have to app ly only one\nstrategy to every person or situation. The broad conversation goals th at were covered earlier in the chapter are\none way  to give yourself some direction (\u201cI\u2019m going to ask about their\ninterests and try to find one we have in common,\u201d \u201cMy grandpa is\ninterested to know what I\u2019ve be en up to lately , so I\u2019ll focus on  telling him\nwhat\u2019 s b een new in my life since I last saw him\u201d). Here are some other\napproaches you can use:\nAppr oach #1: Be inter ested in and curious about other people, and\nmake it your goal to find out what\u2019 s fascinating and unique about them\nThis is the most popular general  approach you\u2019ll hear people me ntion when\nit comes to making conversation. It comes up again and again, going back\nto classic books on people skills like How to W in Fr iends and Influence\nPeople . Th e ide a is primarily to be som eone who asks questions and li stens\nto the answers, which leads to focusing the discussion on the other person. Y our \u201cmission\u201d in the convers ation is to discover what makes the other\nperson interesting. Y ou don\u2019 t need to only listen to  or talk about the other person the entire\ntime; yo u should bring up things about yourself and share  your own\nopinions when relevant. Generally focus the conversation on your partner ,\nbut not to the po int where you share nothing about yourself an d become afor gettable nonentity that just helps other people talk. The underlying assumption abou t this approach is that everyone\u2019 s favorite\nsubject is themselves, and that people like someone who take s a genuine\ninterest in them and the things they have to say . People also tend to feel\ngood ab out a conversation in which they can talk about aspects of\nthemselves that they\u2019re proud o f and passionate about. Another line you\u2019ll\noften he ar in regard to this strategy is that you\u2019ll be more succe ssful taking\nan in terest in other people than you will be by trying to get them interested\nin you. This approach predisposes you to adopt a positive, friendly frame of\nmind. It s basic premise implies that everyone is worth talking to if you dig\npast any preconceptions you ma y have of them. And because you\u2019re likely\nto find somethin g interesting about the other person if you look for it, it\nends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy . Appr oach #2: T alk in terms of the other person\u2019 s inter ests\nFocusing on the other person\u2019 s interests is similar to the approach above, in\nthat you\u2019re mainly listening and  the conversation is based around the other\nperson and things they like discussing. This approach is not exactly the\nsame. The approach above is more general and is about finding people\u2019 s\ngood traits, whatever they may be. This one is more about specifically\ntrying to find out what the other person is interested in talking about,\nwhether it\u2019 s a hobby or a life decision they\u2019re wrestling with, and centering\nthe con versation on that. Y ou take an interest in their interest, ask\nthoughtful questions, and listen as they tell you about it. The limitations of being an interested listenerBoth of these listening / other -person-centric approaches can work very\nwell and  are essential to have in your toolbox. At the same t ime, their\nef fectiveness is sometimes oversold.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>I\thave\twitnessed\tthis\tat\tcompany\tmeetings\tand\tin\tmeetings\twith\ncustomers.\u201d\n\u201cThe\tbest\texample\tI\tcan\tprovide\tfor\tDave\tis\this\tmove\tto\tour\tcompany.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>When a con\ufb02  ict seems overwhelm-\ning, the \ufb01\n rst reaction is usually avoidance. Withdrawal can be de\ufb01  ned as either a physical or a psychological removal from the problem.

Many people fear confrontation beacuse of previous con\ufb02  ict \nexperiences that left deep emotional scars. Withdrawal is seen as a coping style, albeit regres-sive, when con\ufb02  icts involve \ufb01  gures of authority, \nsuch as bosses or parents, or when a person feels outnumbered by colleagues or peers.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>how open everyone is to meeting new people. Are they there to make\nnew friends, or do they plan to stick to the group they came with? Don\u2019t place too much importance on how well you socialize at parties\nParties a re just one way people get together . For the average p erson, they\ncome up  only occasionally . They can be fun and lively , but the y\u2019re not the\nbe-all an d end-all of social inte raction. Some people blow the significance\nof p arties out of proportion and measure how well they get alo ng with the\nstrangers they meet as the ultimate test of their social worthiness. If it\u2019 s\nimportant to you to be able to mingle, then you should work on it. But at the\nsame time, know that plenty of people have great social lives even if\nworking the room and being me morable at big gatherings isn\u2019 t their strong\npoint. Regarding the expectation that  you have to have a caaah-raaazy time,\nmany people\u2019 s idea of a good night at a party is to mainly hang out with the\nfriends they came with in a low-key way , have a couple of drinks, and\nmaybe chat with a person or two they don\u2019 t know . They don\u2019 t feel they\u2019ve\nfailed if they ha ven\u2019 t done a bunch of keg stands, jumped of f a  roof into a\npool, and made twenty new buddies.Deciding the best time to arrive\nHow ea rly or late you show up at a party can influence how comfortable\nyou feel socializing with the other guests. Some people find it\u2019 s good to\narrive ea rly (not  overly early , of  course, because that can inconvenience the\nhost). Fewer guests will have arrived, and you can talk to everyone under\nmore low-key circumstances an d in smaller , more manageable groups. As\nthe other guests trickle in, you can get to know them as they arrive. However , this doesn\u2019 t work for everyone. Some people feel more exposed\nand on the spot if they\u2019re at a party early with hardly anyone e lse. It\u2019 s also\nless of an option if you don\u2019 t know the host(s) that well. The other option is to arrive later , when you\u2019ll have lots of existing groups\nto join. Y ou may also like that you can disappear into the crowd and not feel\nlike you  stand out. If you find a conversation awkward, you can quickly\nescape t o someo ne else, rather than, say , being stuck having to chat with\njust the host and her two good friends for twenty minutes. There are\ndownsides to this approach too. Some people find a room full of  guests who\nare alrea dy talking to each other intimidating. Everyone may b e into their\nconversations, a nd groups can fe el harder to break into. Finally , as the night\ngoes on, people get more rowdy , which may not be your style. W ays to appr oach and chat with people at parties\nPrevious chapters covered how to feel comfortable approaching  people and\nhow to start and  maintain conversations with them, so this section won\u2019 t\nrepeat all of th at. Here are some party-specific ideas for getting into\ninteractions:\nIf you\u2019re going to mingle with strangers on your own, you can t alk to\nwhomever you want to. Pick a person who\u2019 s close to you, or who\nseems interesting or approachable, or just go up to someone atrandom. That may sound too s imple, but you really don\u2019 t ne ed to\nthink about it more than that. Ask the person throwing the p arty to introduce you to ever yone. (This isn\u2019 t always an option, though.)\nGive yo urself a role, like the person who takes people\u2019 s coats and\nshows them where the snacks and drinks are. Join one  of the activities that m ay be going on (for example, a card\ngame, a group watching TV or playing video games in the basement). Initiate a new a ctivity to get people talking, like playing a board\ngame or drinking game (if it\u2019 s  the type of get-together where  that\nwould be appropriate). T wo appr oaches to mingling\nThe first approach to mingling is to be more mechanical and try to have at\nleast a brief con versation with everyone at the event. The seco nd is to go\nwith the  flow , talk to whoever catches your fancy , and see whe re the night\ntakes you. Y ou might end up in a  bunch of short interactions, or you may hit\nit of f with the second group you talk to and spend the rest of the party with\nthem. The try-to-talk-to-everyone approach is more appropriate if you\u2019re hosting\nthe e vent; it\u2019 s expected of you to be polite and say hello to everyone. Y ou\u2019d\nalso use it if it\u2019 s important for you to meet everyone there, or if the party\nhas a business o r networking component and you want to be s ure to make\nthe rounds and talk to everyone  you need to. The more casual approach is\nbest when you\u2019re attending a big ger , purely social party . In thos e situations,\nmost of the gue sts won\u2019 t try to speak to everyone else because it\u2019 s often\nimpractical and would get in the way of their spontaneous fun. Leaving the partySome people find leaving part ies awkward. If you don\u2019 t like  seemingly\nbeing the center of attention as  you announce you\u2019re heading out, that\u2019 s\nsimply somethin g you can get used to in time. If you\u2019re not sure how to say\nyour good-byes,  it\u2019 s polite to let at least the host(s) and your good friends\nknow yo u\u2019re taking of f. If you\u2019ve met some new people you\u2019d like to stay\nin to uch with, y ou can track th em down and get their contact info before\nyou go. Don\u2019 t feel you have to  tell every last guest you\u2019re done for the\nnight. W hoever you tell, just sa y you\u2019re heading of f and don\u2019 t think you\nhave to  have a five-minute g oing-away chat. There\u2019 s no need to act\nsheepish if you\u2019re leaving early .</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>In fact, Matt spent a fair amount of time in and out of hospitals.

A dream journal . Dreams make fascinating \nma terial for journal entries. Jung, remember, \nbelieved attempting to understand the symbolism of one\u2019s dreams would lead to psychic equilib-rium, a balance of the conscious and unconscious minds promoting personal wholeness. Often the loose ends of perceptions and emotions associated with stress materialize in the dream state as the unconscious mind works on its own analysis and resolution process of thoughts and sensory infor-mation received in the conscious state. The unconscious mind is rich in color and symbols, yet poor in its ability to express these symbols as words. Thus, the collaboration of the conscious and unconscious minds is a dynamic one to deal with stressors. It should be noted that with the massive proliferation of television, DVDs, and other media entertainment, dreams may be less a function of our own thoughts and more a func-tion of making sense or relating to that which we are consuming from these venues. Regardless, dreams should not be discounted! Although we often do not remember all our dreams, everyone does dream. But many times, dreams seem to fade into thin air the second we wake up and enter the conscious world. Re \nsearchers who study dreams \nhave come up with the following list of ways to help people remember their dreams:\na. Before you go to sleep, write a review of the \nday\u2019s events and your feelings about them. b. As you drift off to sleep, remind yourself, si-\nlently or out loud, that you want to remember your dreams.c. Reserve a few quiet moments, with your \neyes closed, when you wake up to recall your dreams. Linger in a semi-dream state to ob-serve dream thoughts. d. Keep your journal and a pen/pencil handy by \nyour bedside to record your dream thoughts or fragments when you wake up. e. Dream thoughts can surface to the conscious \nstate when triggered by some event in the course of your day. Write down any dream fragments. Return to the passages describing your dream \nimages and ponder what their symbolism can reveal to you. Jung believed that every dream was a source of information. Prompt recording of your dreams can help prevent distortions created by the conscious mind. Journal writing can also be a good outlet to draft a written closure or \ufb01  nal \nscene of a recurring dream. Recurring dreams often represent serious unresolved issues that need to be addressed. Although writing a \ufb01  nal \nscene to a recurring dream may not fully resolve each stressful issue, it does initiate increased awareness that may aid in the resolution of the stressor that causes this type of dream. 4.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

Y ou have to\ntreat the se intera ctions like a game and find ways to get your fair share of\nthe spotlight. Below are some ways to become the speaker . All of these behaviors are\nmore ac ceptable in wild group conversations than in standard day-to-day\ngroup co nversations. Y ou can still go overboard, but if you don\u2019 t do them\ntoo obnoxiously , no one takes these behaviors too personally . Make it really , really obvious w ith your body language that you  want\nto talk after the current speaker is finished by leaning forward, raising\nyour hand slightly , and catching  everyone\u2019 s eye to let them know you\nwant to speak next. Make a statement such as, \u201cI\u2019ve got something to say about that after\nshe\u2019 s done.\u201d\nBe the first one out of the gate when one person finishes talking. Interrupt someone or cut them of f after they\u2019ve spoken for a while. Raise your voice to overpower anyone else who\u2019 s also trying to be\nthe next to talk. Repeat the beginning of your statement several times until y ou\u2019re\ngiven the floor . Bring your point up again a minute later if you weren\u2019 t able to\nbecome the speaker on your first try .

T alk quickly to get your point out before someone cuts you of f.Make your statements to the point. Y ou won\u2019 t get away with\nrambling on. Use gestures to indicate to othe r people that you\u2019re not done ta lking\nso th ey shouldn\u2019 t cut you of f.

Many people have painful mem ories of times they tried to chip in to a\ngroup discussio n and got ignored or talked over , even if they repeated\nthemselves seve ral times. Reading about group dynamics may help put\nthose experiences in perspective. Getting overlooked like this happens to\neveryone from time to time, an d it\u2019 s nothing personal. When people are\nreally f ocused on following group conversations and are  also busy\nstrategizing abo ut how they can talk next, they can inadvertently tune out\nthe other members who are trying to jump in. W ays to ease the madness and help other people be included\nY ou hav e to accept that these conversations can get hairy and go  along with\ntheir unw ritten rules to a point, but you can do some things to try to rein\nthem in too. De pending on how many people are in the group and how\namped up they are, your ef forts may not have a huge ef fect, but you can try . If you\u2019re good at getting your speech time, don\u2019 t be selfish. Ease of f\na bit to give other people space to contribute. Help the  quieter  or less eager people in the group get a chance t o talk\nby signaling to the others that they have something they\u2019d like to say . If you can tell someone really wants to finish a point, and you\u2019retempted to interrupt, try to resist that ur ge.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Self-disclosure is based on mutual trust. It is believed by those who study communication skills that all verbal communication involves some element of self-disclosure. It can be a dou-ble-edged sword, for there is risk in divulging personal insights and feelings. When individuals sense that shar-ing feelings will promote a closer relationship or bond-ing, then the risk is assessed as minimal and opening up is worth it. If rejection or alienation may ensue, however, then the degree of openness will be greatly limited. Likewise, when trust has been violated in the past, the ability to self-disclose is greatly compromised. One might think that the closer two people are, the greater the depth of self-disclosure there is, and initially this may be true.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2.

Trained in Jungian psychology, Progoff discovered that his own journal writ-ing allowed direct access to a higher consciousness or spir-itual awareness, which encouraged the search for meaning in his own life. The fruits of these efforts led him to share this coping technique with others who might bene\ufb01  t from \nit. Journal writing, Progoff suggested, allows for the syn-thesis of personal thoughts, feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and insights toward spiritual growth. In 1966, he estab-lished a seminar, called the Intensive Journal Workshop, in which he trained participants in the art of journal writ-ing for self-improvement. Progoff \u2019s method of journal writing, with its use of a three-ringed notebook divided into twenty-one sections separating various components of one\u2019s thoughts, sought to open doors in the mind through various themes or springboards to self-explora-tion. His sections included Daily Log, Stepping Stones, Time Stretching, Dialogue Dimension, Imagery Extensions, A Personal Autobiography, and Dream Interpretation, as well as a series of personal dialogues on a host of topics, from body awareness to societal expecta-tions. Collectively, these topics provided lessons in mak-ing order out of chaos from the glut of sensory information that is continually processed in the mind. Journal writing, Progoff said, allows the writer to initiate a positive con-frontation with several issues that contribute to the under-standing of one\u2019s personal existence. In an experiment to examine the effects of journal writ-\ning on personal growth, 300 people were recruited from New York City\u2019s welfare and unemployment programs and introduced to the practice through Progoff \u2019s work-shop, in conjunction with a job training program. Within a 12-month period, more than 90 percent of those enrolled in the workshop improved their job sta-tus and housing conditions. Credit for these improve-ments was given to the enhanced state of self-reliance attained through journal writing. As Progoff states in his book At a Journal Workshop , journal writing \u201cplays \nan active role in reconstructing a life, but it does so with-out imposing any external categories or interpretations or theories of the individual\u2019s experience. It remains neutral and open-ended so as to maintain the integrity of each person\u2019s development, while drawing him fur-ther along the road of his own life process.\u201d He refers to journal writing as transpsychological, a word describ-\ning the therapeutic effects of self-discovery through active awareness, which allows the individual to access personal resources and promotes wholeness. The Intensive Journal Workshop offered a very orga-\nnized method to journal writing, yet some people felt it lacked the spontaneity and freedom that make self-expression through journal writing unique. The cur-rent approach to journal writing, advocated by journal therapist Kathleen Adams, is called humanistic journal therapy, where journal writing is a vehicle for the devel-opment and maintenance of the transpersonal self or the bonding between oneself and one\u2019s enlightened self. In Jungian psychology, the transpersonal self would be described as a union of the conscious and unconscious minds through communication of words, symbols, and dreams to enhance human potential. In the past 20 to 30 years, journal writing has often been \ncombined with other coping techniques for personal growth.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Printing press. Airplane. Cotton gin. Telephone. Each one has become an item of necessity. Necessity, it is said, is the mother of invention, and the human \nmind has risen to the occasion to create some fantastic inventions. There is no better time for necessity to bear the fruits of creativity than during times of frustration when one needs to get from point A to point B. At one time, the United States took pride in its American \ningenuity. Young in age and pregnant with possibilities, early generations of Americans made more improve-ments to the proverbial mouse trap than there are stars in the sky. Before the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was a productive society, the vast major-ity of its citizens making more than 70 percent of their household items themselves. As the country became a consumer society, however, more and more items were bought rather than made at home. The availability of several new inventions, like the washer and dryer, pro-vided more leisure time. But with some of these inven-tions, lifestyles became very comfortable, and our collective creative skills became dull (Mander, 1978; Jackson, 2004). With the advent of television, it is said, the creative American mind began showing signs of atrophy. People now take a passive role in the creative process, letting other people do the important, creative thinking. Experts agree that a happy mind is a creative mind. The inability to deal with many problems is directly related to the inability to tap into and utilize creativity. It would be unfair to point the \ufb01  nger of blame solely at television. Many critics believe that the American educational system continues to play a role in the decline of creative skills as well, by sti\ufb02  ing the limits of imagination with conformity and critical-thinking skills. More over, American companies are now looking to hire Asians who are deemed more creative. The dominant style of thinking in the Western hemisphere is considered left-brained: linear, logical and rational, analytical, and judgmental. Left-brain modes of think-ing are those most rewarded in both school and work environments. And this style of thinking has devalued recreational and play time.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "1.

You seek problems because you need their gifts. \u2014Richard BachPart 3\n56147_CH08_195_215.indd   19556147_CH08_195_215.indd   195 10/1/08   11:03:52 AM10/1/08   11:03:52 AMWhen we encounter a situation or event \nwe perceive as a stressor, some part of us feels very vulnerable and threat-ened. To survive the threat, whether \nminimal or colossal, some type of coping strategy is cre-ated to deal with it. Each stressor necessitates its own coping strategy. Some coping strategies are second na-ture to most people when the stressor is minimal, and a course of  action is taken with little or no conscious thought involved. But as the number and intensity of stressors increases and a critical mass of tension mani-fests, then routine coping strategies may fail to do an effective job. The result can be feelings of immobili-zation, mental paralysis, and emotional fatigue until a more effective coping technique, or combination of techniques, is employed. For the most part, the expres-sion coping responses , unlike defense mechanisms, has a \npositive connotation, suggesting that a positive outcome is likely. However, this is not always the case, as some coping behaviors perpetuate stress rather than promote inner peace. The word coping, as de\ufb01  ned by stress scholar Richard \nLazarus (1981), is \u201cthe process of managing demands that \nare appraised as taxing or exceeding the individual\u2019s resources.\u201d He went on to add that coping consists of both cognitive and action-oriented (behavioral) efforts. According to Lazarus, this managing process involves several important criteria, including some or all of the following: an increased awareness process of oneself, the situation, and the environment; an emotional regulation process he referred to as palliative coping; and quite often, a series of behavioral changes, referred to as instru-mental coping, which accompany this awareness and cognitive pro cess. Lazarus also believed that coping isn\u2019t the employment of several techniques so much as it is a speci\ufb01  c frame of mind. Part of this mind frame is a per-\nsonality trait, self-ef\ufb01  cacy, a term coined by psychologist \nAlbert Bandura to describe an inner sense of faith culmi-nating in a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude. Self-ef\ufb01  cacy describes \naccess to several inner resources including self-con\ufb01  -\ndence, faith, will power, and self-reliance. The possession and implementation of this trait tend to divide those who choose  effective coping strategies from those who elect non effective ones. In other words, your dominant coping style may be a function of your personality. To date, the best and most comprehensive conceptual \nmodel to understand the coping process is that created by Lazarus and colleagues. According to Lazarus, every stressor undergoes primary appraisal to determine the extent of damage. It is then reprocessed in a secondary appraisal. At this point, a series of coping responses are lined up with the stressor to see which is the best course of action. These coping responses fall into one of two catego-ries: action-oriented, such as time management or asser-tive behavior, or intrapsychic (acceptance). The responses used to cope with stress can be derived internally (from inner resources) and/or externally. Inner resources include, among other things, willpower, sense of humor, creativ-ity, sense of reason, self-ef\ufb01  cacy, faith, and optimism. External resources would include time, money, and social support from friends and family. Lazarus cites the pur-poses of coping skills as the following:\n 1.

D i s c o u r a g e m e n t  /  p e s s i m i s m\nFeeling discoura ged or pessimistic is an issue that is dif ferent fro m the three\nabove, b ut often  goes hand in hand with them. The methods for addressing\nit are the same  as well. A history of poor social outcomes can lead to\npessimism and discouragement about meeting your goals to improve your\nsocial situation. Feeling discouraged can then cause you to develop a\nnumber of counterproductive m ind-sets that can hinder you even further . It\ncan also  lead to self-sabotaging  behavior where you don\u2019 t try because you\n\u201cknow\u201d you\u2019ll fail anyway . Here are some typical discouraging thoughts:\n\u201cI\u2019m too unlikable. There\u2019 s no point in trying anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI could go to that party , but it won\u2019 t get me anywhere, so I\u2019ll take a\npass.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably reject me, so I won\u2019 t bother talking to them.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem bored by me. I\u2019ll bow out of the conversation now to\nsave us both time.\u201d\n\u201cHe just gave me his number and said we should grab a beer\nsometime. It never works out when I follow up with someone, so I\nwon\u2019 t bother .\u201d\n\u201cMaybe other awkward people can improve, but my set of issues is\ntoo much to overcome.\u201dThe fou r related problems of shyness, social anxiety , insecurity , and\ndiscouragement need to be tackled directly . Y ou should do som e work on\nthem be fore wor king on conversation or social life issues you want to fix. If\nyou\u2019re s hy and insecure around people, you can indirectly become more\nconfident by developing you r conversation and friend-ma king skills\n(assuming they\u2019 re not already fine and your shyness just blocks them from\ncoming out). One warning though: If you attempt to practice your social\nskills bu t haven\u2019 t taken steps to  address the counterproductive thinking at\nthe core of your  shyness and an xiety , you may end up worse of f. Y ou\u2019ll put\nyourself in social situations but still see them as dangerous and high-stakes;\nif so mething goes wrong, you may come to inaccurate, disheartening\nconclusions about yourself and your hopes of improving. Y ou d on\u2019 t have to\nget your thinking to a flawless place before you start working on your\npeople skills, but your though ts should be at a level where they won\u2019 t\ncompletely sabotage you either .4\nS h i f t i n g  y o u r  M i n d - S e t  a b o u t  Y o u r  S o c i a l\nD i s c o m f o r t\nB EFORE  YOU  CAN  ST AR T  WORKING  on  any shyness, anxiety , or  lack of\nconfidence, you  need to develo p the right mind-set for dealing  with these\nproblems. People often believe two big myths that give their social\ndiscomfort too much power and hinder their ability to deal with it:\n1 . \u201cThere must be a way to tot ally eradicate my shyness, social\nanxiety , and insecurities (and the refore I\u2019ll put improving my social\nlife on hold until I do that).\u201d\n2 . \u201cI c an\u2019 t show any signs of social discomfort to people. It\u2019 s\nshameful and will ruin the interaction.\u201d\nY ou\u2019ll h ave to do some work,  but you can limit the impact of these\ncounterproductive mind-sets. This chapter presents some useful attitudes to\nadopt re garding social situations . If you keep these points in min d, you\u2019ll be\non y our way to feeling more comfortable around people and h andling any\nuneasiness that pops up along the way . K n o w  a n d  a c c e p t  t h a t  y o u \u2019 l l  n e v e r  b a n i s h  a l l  s o c i a l\nd i s c o m f o r t  f r o m  y o u r  l i f e\nAlthough the strategies in the following chapters will help you  turn down\nthe dial on yo ur social discomfort, you\u2019ll never banish those issues\ncompletely . Humans just aren\u2019 t wired to be blissfully happy and self-assured 100 percent of the time. Even if you learn and apply every coping\nstrategy there is, you need to accept that the following things will still\nhappen:\nAt times you\u2019ll have worried, insecure, or counterproductive\nthoughts, even if you use every technique you know to try to make\nthem go away . Sometimes you\u2019ll feel anxious, regardless of how much you try to\ncontrol it or logically realize there\u2019 s nothing to fret about. Some situations will always make you a little nervous, even if you\u2019ve\nsuccessfully gone through them plenty of times (for example, most\npeople never get entirely comfortable with public speaking or trying\nto start a conversation with someone they\u2019re attracted to). There will be instances where you\u2019ll make a mistake, get rejected, or\nlook bad in a social situation, even if you do everything you can to\nprevent it. Y ou\u2019ll feel down on yourself at times, no matter how much you try to\npsych yourself up or remind yourself of your strengths. Even if you seem to have your shyness and insecurities under\ncontrol, you may go through a stressful period in your life that makes\nthem flare up again. Y ou\u2019ll never be able to predict the future or have full certainty an\nupcoming social event will go well. Y ou may have been born with a tendency to be more anxious and\ninsecure than average, and it\u2019 s something you\u2019ll have to learn to work\naround. Accepting that you may sometimes get uncomfortable in social situations\ntakes away some of the control your shyness and insecurities have over you. For example, if you think awkward silences are terrible, you\u2019ll avoidcountless conve rsations in an attempt to only chat to someone under the\nperfect, safe set of conditions. If you make peace with the fact that lulls\nhappen sometimes, no matter how prepared you are, you\u2019ll be willing to\ntalk to more people. Even wh en you  really don\u2019 t wa nt a certain outcome, you\u2019ll of ten feel a\nkind of relief when you know for sure it\u2019 s going to happen. At least the\nuncertainty and \u201cwhat if?\u201d wor rying are gone, and you can focus on how\nyou\u2019re going to handle it. If you knew with 100 percent certainty you were\ngoing to stumble over your w ords whenever you met someone new , it\nwould be inconvenient, but you could shift your ener gy toward  coming up\nwith strategies to deal with that fact. A i m  t o  b e c o m e  s o c i a l l y  f u n c t i o n a l ,  r a t h e r  t h a n  1 0 0\np e r c e n t  a s s u r e d  a t  a l l  t i m e s\nAfter yo u accept that you\u2019re st ill going to encounter some social unease\nfrom time to time, your aim should be to become socially functional , where\neven if you\u2019re nervous or self-doubting, you can still meet your goals. Don\u2019 t\nput your social life on hold un til you wipe all shyness from your mind,\nbecause that will never happen. A key part of being functional is to realize\nyou can be shy , nervous, or insecure during a social event and s till function\nand ultimately enjoy yourself. Socializing while experiencing a case of the jitters\nWhen p eople struggle with social anxiety , they sometimes look at their\ndiscomfort in either\u2013or terms when they\u2019re deciding whether to attend a\nget-together . They think if they\u2019re not completely confident and relaxed,\nthen they have to skip it. If ne rves strike when they\u2019re with people, they\nthink the whole outing is ruined.Y ou can get through most social  situations with some self-doubt or jitters. If your nerves or insecurities are mild, they may not interfere with your\noutward performance at all. Even if they trip you up a little, they won\u2019 t fully\nruin the interaction. Only the m ost extreme, sustained anxiety will do that. A co nversation can easily be a success, even if you trembled or  had trouble\nputting your thoughts together at the beginning of it. When looking back at an outing, how nervous or unsure you were at the\ntime becomes even less importa nt. If you get nervous in crowds but go to\nsee your  favorit e band anyway , five years from now you\u2019ll be happy you\nwent an d cherish the good memories you have; you\u2019ll hardly  regret the\nexperience because you felt on edge at the start of the show .

As long as  a step is leading up to that, it\u2019 s okay . For\nexample, if you\u2019re afraid of going to nightclubs, just setting foot in one for\na minute  may be all you can ha ndle at first. That\u2019 s fine as long as you\u2019re\nusing it as a jumping-of f point to stay longer next time. Similar fears can be tackled similarly\nSocial fe ars com e in many form s, and some of them need to be tackled on a\ncase-by-case ba sis. However , some fears are similar and can be faced insimilar ways, which is helpful if you experience variations of the same fear:\nFears of being in a certain environment, like a party , a dance club, or\na movie theater where you\u2019re seeing a film alone. In this case, your\ngoal for each fear -facing session is to put yourself in that\nenvironment. Eventually you want to be able to stay there long\nenough that you start to calm down and realize that nothing bad is\ngoing to happen. Fears about certain types of interactions, like making conversation,\napproaching strangers, or inviting friends to hang out. The\ninteractions themselves are often on the shorter side, so in each fear -\nfacing session, you should try to carry them out multiple times. The\nfirst conversation you have might be nerve-racking, but the seventh\nmay feel quite tolerable. Of course, this volume approach isn\u2019 t\nalways possible. If you shy away from inviting people out, you may\nnot have enough friends and acquaintances to invite every time you\nwant to practice facing that particular fear .

Substituting a positive atti-tude for a negative perception may make you feel vulnerable at \ufb01  rst, but like other skills that improve with practice, a new comfort will emerge. With cognitive restructuring, the new mind frame must often be substituted when the stress is encountered, and repeated again and again.Chapter 8\n212Over the years I have asked various people for their de\ufb01  -\nnitions of optimists and pessimists.

Scholars concur that it is not the \ncircumstance that is stressful, but the perception or inter-pretation of the circumstance. We now know that if the perception is negative, it can become both a mental and physical liability. Whatever the event, perceptions can become distorted and magni\ufb01  ed entirely out of propor-tion to their seriousness. This is referred to as cognitive distortion (mole hills into mountains), and it turns ev-eryday problems into gigantic monsters. Attempts have been made to deal with the \u201cstress monster\u201d from all angles, including decreasing or manipulating sensory information and teaching people to control the stress response by employing various relaxation techniques. Perhaps the coping skill most advocated\u2014which goes right to the heart of the matter but is initially very dif-\ufb01 cult to employ\u2014is favorably alter ing the stressful per-\nception of the circumstance that has precipitated feel-ings of anger and/or fear. This alteration in perception is made through changes in cognition. Cognition is the mental process that includes an  assortment of thinking and reasoning skills. Across the country, this coping technique goes by several names: cognitive restructur-ing, cognitive reappraisal, cognitive relabeling, cogni-tive reframing, cognitive therapy, and attitude adjust-ment. Despite the variations, they all suggest the same approach: to favorably alter the current mind frame to a less threatening perception, from a negative, self-defeat-ing attitude to a positive one, which may then allow the initiation of the steps toward a peaceful resolution.The seeds of cognitive therapy took root in 1962 with the work of Albert Ellis in what he referred to as ratio-nal emotive behavior therapy (REBT). The premise of \nEllis\u2019s work was that stress-related behaviors are initi-ated by perceptions and that these self-defeating percep-\ntions can be changed.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

For example, crossed arms\ncan be a sign that someone is bored or guarded, but it could also mean they\nfind the position comfortable. Y ou need to weigh that one piece of\ninformation in light of everything else. If they\u2019ve been smiling and eagerly\ntalking t o you the whole time t hey\u2019ve had their arms crossed, it probably\ndoesn\u2019 t mean anything. If they suddenly cross their arms while turning\naway from you and making a disapproving face, that\u2019 s another story .

Sometimes a feeling only flashes across someone\u2019 s face for a split second. T one of voice:  Y o u could co nsider tone of voice a part of verbal\ncommunication, but it\u2019 s included with the other nonverbal signals because it\ncan mod ify the meaning of someone\u2019 s words.

If you\u2019re used to\nalways looking down and away  in conversations, it can be tiring to\ncontinually look up at someone\u2019 s face and hold your focus on it. Resting facial expr essionIdeally you want your neut ral face to look relaxed, happy , and\napproachable. Y ou don\u2019 t need to walk around grinning like a clown at all\ntimes, bu t it\u2019 s good if you can seem reasonably content. Some people create\nthe wrong impression because their face unintentionally looks nervous,\nbored, angry , zoned out, or unfriendly . There are a few reasons this can\nhappen:\nThey actually are feeling that way and may not be aware of it (for\nexample, they\u2019r e more checked out than they realize at the of fice\nChristmas party). Their facial features naturally m ake them look that way (for example,\nsomeone with lar ge eyes may seem more stunned and ner vous;\nsomeone with a prominent brow may look angrier). Their overall look matches a stereotype (for example, if someone\ndresses in a stere otypical hippie or stoner style, people may read  their\nneutral expression as zoned out and dopey). They don\u2019 t always give of f a misleading expression, but some of\ntheir moods can be mistaken fo r others ones (for example, they look\nannoyed when they\u2019re tired, or bored when they\u2019re deep in thought). As with other facets of your nonverbal communication, yo ur resting\nexpression may shift as you change your mentality and social skills. If you\ntend to look nervous, that may go away as you become more comfortable\naround people. Y ou may start to look more relaxed and happy at parties,\nrather than bored, when you know how to mingle and unlock their fun. It\u2019 s too draining to do all the time, but when it\u2019 s important to d o so, you\ncan cons ciously try to wear a happy , approachable facial express ion; simply\nsmile sli ghtly , o pen your eyes m ore, and relax your features. If  you\u2019re tall,\nlower your chin so you don\u2019 t accidentally look down your nose at people. Y ou may also be  able to adjust the impression you create with s ome tweaksto your groomin g, style, and posture. For example, if your eyebrows are\nnaturally downturned and grouc hy looking, a little plucking may change the\nvibe the y give of f.

Art therapy is based on the premise that many thoughts, feelings, and insights are verbally inexpressible. Several abstract constructs of the human mind lack the neces-sary vocabulary to adequately describe the focus, in-tensity, and understanding of daily encounters that the mind tries to process and grasp. This is only exacerbated in times of stress. Self-expression through visual artistic media offers a balance to verbal expression in the search for wholeness through the understanding of our personal thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and attitudes. Art therapy has been described by the American Art \nTherapy Association as \u201cthe use of art in a creative pro-cess to provide the opportunity for a nonverbal expres-sion and communication in which to reconcile and foster self-awareness and personal growth.\u201d Art therapy is centered on exploration of the individual\u2019s internal landscape, carved and shaped by one\u2019s collective experi-ences and delivered through a visual, artistic sense. Art therapy can strengthen the bonds of self-communica-tion, thereby promoting greater self-awareness and self-comfort. Art therapy can also be described as a voy-age of self-discovery, with process and product uniting to promote self-realization and self-healing. For this reason, art therapy is considered a coping technique in the strategic plan to deal with stress because awareness of problems must occur before steps to resolve perceived stress can be taken. If you consider that your thoughts and behaviors are a \nproduct of your unconscious mind (Chapter 8), and the unconscious mind communicates in symbols, colors, and images, rather than words, then tapping into the wealth and power of the unconscious mind as a means to cope with stress is advantageous, if not essential, for everyone. Art therapy is a proven way to do just this. Origins of Art Therapy\nThe seeds of this discipline took root as early as the \ufb01  eld \nof professional psychology itself. At the turn of the twen-\ntieth century, Freud and Jung engaged several of their patients in drawing to better understand several psycho-logical disorders through the visual expression of their emotions. But it was the work of Margaret Naumburg, an American art teacher and director of Walden Art School, who found the use of art a powerful form of thera-peutic communication for several children she taught. Naumburg observed that self-expression through spon-taneous art became a psychotherapeutic treatment in its own right.

Basically, this is a call for help, in \nwhich one seeks divine guidance or, more likely, divine intervention. Intercessory prayer is most common in two situations. The \ufb01  rst is when you need help yourself; the second is when you offer a prayer for the assistance of others. Those who study the nuances of prayer describe it \nFaith: An optimistic attitude adopted to cope with \nstress for which one perceives a connection to some-thing bigger than oneself (e.g., a divine source). Intercessory prayer: One style of prayer for which \nthe individual seeks assistance from a higher (divine) source to intervene or assist with his or her problems. Prayer (from any denomination of faith) is viewed as a tremendous \ncoping technique, particularly for fear and anxiety.

The concepts described below often happen automatically\nas a  friendship progresses, b ut you can take some control of your\nrelationships by deliberately try ing to use these points. They mainly apply\nto in dividual friends, but some of them also carry over to becom ing tighter\nwith a group. Some things to know going in:\nTher e\u2019 s no formula to becoming better friends with everybody you\nmeet\nNot everyone you meet is going to want to hang out with you. And even if\nyou get along on  a surface level,  not everyone you hang out with is going to\nbecome a closer friend.

On t he same not e, just because y ou may be able to successfully apply one\nor m ore of the ideas below to so meone, that won\u2019 t guarantee the friendship\nis g oing to go anywhere. For example, you may have a rea lly intimateconversation with them, but overall they\u2019ll continue to think of you as\nsomeone they run into every now and then. If you\u2019re making an ef fort to\nbecome better friends with som eone and you get the sense you\u2019re putting\nmore en er gy int o it than they are, consider backing of f and adjusting your\nexpectations. Sometimes you\u2019ll become good friends with someone pr etty quickly; at\nother times it takes a while\nMany p eople have had the e xperience of meeting someone new and\nimmediately sta rting to hang ou t with them nearly every day . Just as many\nhave frie ndships where the bond grew more gradually . Neither progression\nis be tter than th e other . Friendships can get of f the ground quickly in the\nfollowing situations:\nwhen you just click with a person unusually well;\nwhen yo u\u2019re bo th at a place in your lives where you\u2019re looking for\nnew friends (for example, during the first weeks of college);\nwhen you\u2019re both available and easily accessible to each other (for\nexample, you live in the same building and have lots of free time to\nhang out);\nwhen you fulfill an unmet need in each other \u2019 s lives (for exa mple,\nyou absolutely love reading and  discussing books, but none of  your\nother friends care much about them);\nwhen you\u2019re in a situation whe re the usual standards for frien dship\nprogression don\u2019 t apply , like when you meet people while trav eling\nand feel like friends for life after knowing them for only five days. Friendships can grow more slowly\nwhen on e or both of you are pretty busy with your day-to-day livesand/or already have many friends who fill up your calendar;\nwhen yo u get along well enough, but there isn\u2019 t that instant spa rk of\nintense compatibility;\nwhen you\u2019re not actively trying to deepen your friendship with them. For example, they\u2019re on the per iphery of your social circle, and  you\nget to know them better here and there. It\u2019 s natural to feel a bit awkward and insecur e as a new friendship\nbegins\nThere ar e times when you\u2019ll hit  it of f with someone right away and never\nfeel uncomforta ble around them. There are also those times where your\nfriendships will develop in a low-stakes, almost accidental way . However ,\nsometimes the process is more nerve-racking, like if you meet someone at a\none-of f event and then actively try to start a friendship with them. Here it\u2019 s\nunderstandable t hat things will feel uncertain because you\u2019re not sure how\nmuch they like y ou or if you\u2019ll continue to get along and have things to say\nto each other . It usually takes a month or so before you start to feel more\nrelaxed and secure about the relationship. W a y s  t o  d e v e l o p  a  n e w  f r i e n d s h i p\nEvery fr iendship is dif ferent, and not every point will apply to every type\nequally . Some friendships are more about sharing and connec ting, while\nothers are based around hobbies, joking around, and going out at night. Spend mor e time together\nSimply spending more time with someone is the backbone of becoming\nbetter friends with them. A close relationship isn\u2019 t something that happens\nin a few hours. Y ou need spac e for all the relationship-enhancing thingscovered below to happen. T ime is an important enough factor that we often\nbecome good friends with the people we naturally have a lot of contact\nwith, lik e coworkers, friends of friends, classmates, and team members. W ith tim e, friendships can even develop between people who were initially\nindif ferent to each other . Make an effort to hang out with them r egularly\nThe main way to  spend enough time with someone is to hang out with them\nfairly often. Sometimes you\u2019ll b e in a situation where you\u2019ll automatically\nput in those hou rs. If not, you should try to use the ideas in t he previous\nchapter to or ganize get-togethe rs so you can continue seeing them. W ith\nsome people, you\u2019ll quickly fall into a routine of hanging out all the time. W ith oth ers, you  may only be able to get together every three weeks for a\nquick bite to eat. This step needs to be ongoing . It\u2019 s not about coordinating a one-time\nhangout. It\u2019 s about putting in th e ef fort to keep seeing them c ontinuously\nover a period of months. Y ou might have trouble here because:\nY ou\u2019re a  bit too busy or lazy , and don\u2019 t put in the work to see your\nnew friends regularly . Y ou\u2019re shy and reluctant to invi te someone to hang out becaus e you\nfear rejection or an awkward m oment. This most often comes up\nduring the first few invites, but may subtly af fect your actions later if\nyou believe your friend is \u201cabove\u201d you. Y ou\u2019re insecure and prone to thinking you\u2019re not worth ha nging\naround and your new friends must not really like you. Y ou don\u2019 t have the highest need to socialize, and it causes you to not\ninitiate get-togethers as often as needed to keep your new friendships\ngoing.Spend one-on-one time talking with them\nPeople can get to know each other and bond in a group setting, but often the\nreal opp ortunities to connect come when it\u2019 s just you and one o ther person. Also, if you haven\u2019 t hung out wi th someone on your own, how close is your\nfriendship really? Many people have known someone through group\noutings, but have seen a dif ferent side of them when they star ted hanging\nout as a pair . Th ey\u2019ll point to that as when their friendship real ly started to\ndevelop. Y ou could get that one -on-one time by arranging to do something\nwith the m separ ately . Y ou could also find moments to break of f with them\nfrom the  lar ger group. For exam ple, the two of you may be able to retreat to\nthe backyard to talk at a party . Keep up with them in between hanging out\nOne thin g that distinguishes closer friends from more casual ones is how\nmuch th ey stay in contact between times when they hang out in person. Good friends often keep in touch. More casual buddies think along the lines\nof, \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to see them when we run into each other in person, but I\ndon\u2019 t ne ed to keep up with them otherwise.\u201d Especially if you\u2019re not\nhanging out with your new friends all the time, keep up w ith them in\nbetween get-togethers.

Steps to Initiate Art Therapy\nThe beauty of art therapy is that anyone can participate and its signi\ufb01  cant therapeutic effect bene\ufb01  ts not only cancer patients but anyone experiencing the signs and symptoms of perceived stress. In this case, as with other coping and relaxation techniques, the word therapy does not re\ufb02  ect weakness or needing help. Rather, art ther-apy serves to augment understanding of the personal awareness and resolution process. Art therapy appears to trigger a progression of two responses. The \ufb01  rst is a cathartic effect, whereby you can release pent-up emo-tions and thoughts from your mind onto paper (or clay). The second is a greater sense of personal awareness based on an objective look at or interpretation of the artwork\u2014that is, the message it suggests or implies. This interpretation or awareness is often a communica-tion from the unconscious mind regarding less-than-obvious symbolic images.

If you\npurposely try to build someone up by cooing over every little th ing they do,\nit can seem very transparent, patronizing, and manipulative. It\u2019 s more than\nenough to compliment someone or tell them you\u2019re impressed by something\nthey\u2019ve done when the opportu nity comes up naturally . Being a decent,\nfriendly person who\u2019 s intereste d in others also makes people feel good\nabout themselves. If you want to work on this poin t, you should put most of your e ner gy into\nnot being petty and undermining. Perhaps you know someone who isn\u2019 t a\nblatant j erk, but who\u2019 s always pe ppering their interactions with cutting littlecomments.

Maybe you cou ld meet that\nold buddy for lunch and be introduced to their friends soon after . Pursue your hobbies as a way to meet people\nWhen y ou\u2019re in university , you can meet lots of friends through your\nclasses, living arrangements, and part-time jobs. If you m eet anyone\nthrough a hobby , it\u2019 s almost a bonus. After college is over , your interests\nbecome a lot more central to your social life. People who have a lot of\nsocial hobbies have an easier time making friends. If they\u2019re settling down\nin a new city , it \u2019 s natural for th em to join a bunch of teams, get involved\nwith a theater g roup, or start v olunteering somewhere. Before long, they\nhave a social circle. It\u2019 s harder for people who have more solita ry interests\nlike reading, watching movies, or going for long hikes by themselves.

Y ou don \u2019 t need to totally overhaul your personality or all of yo ur pastimes,\nbut tweak how you spend your  time so you can meet as man y friends as\nyou\u2019d lik e. Do more activities o utside of the house. Find a way to use your\nexisting hobbies to put you in contact with more people. For example, if\nyou normally exercise at home, join a class or running club. If you like\nreading about new ideas, attend some free talks or seminars, or join a book\ndiscussion club. If you like stand-up comedy , see if there are any Internet\nmeet-ups where fans can arrange to go to shows together . Be mor e active about seizing opportunities with potential friendsWhen you\u2019re in college, you can af ford to be a bit lazy about making\nfriends.

A lot of\nhobby-related ve nues like dance classes or rock-climbing gyms have people\nwho onl y drop in a handful of times and then move on. When  you meet a\nperson y ou coul d imagine yourself being friends with and there\u2019 s a chance\nyou may not cross paths with them again, be more active about getting their\ncontact information. Then follow up on the lead fairly quickly .

As a \ndefense mechanism, mismanagement of time is actually considered a good quality. Scott also cites several myths people harbor with respect \nto the feasibility of effective time-management skills. One myth is the illusion that time is an adjustable, rather than \ufb01  xed, variable and that there are more than 24 hours in a day. This perception suggests that there will always be \u201cmore time\u201d to get a job done. A second myth, perhaps based on one\u2019s prior experience, is that time-management techniques just don\u2019t work. This perception arises when speci\ufb01  c time-management skills are used individually instead of collectively and then fail to meet expectations. Another common perception is that a methodical strategy to organize oneself is unex-citing and even boring, compared to the stimulation of a crisis orientation. In other words, some people (e.g., codependents) thrive on crisis management. Personality Styles and Behaviors\nTo try to understand the attitudes that become obsta-cles to ef\ufb01  cient time management, scholars have also targeted behaviors that in\ufb02  uence one\u2019s personality as a \nwhole. Six distinct personality behaviors have become evident. These are Type A\u2019s, workaholics, time jug-glers, procrasti nators, perfectionists, and those who fall into lifestyle traps. These behaviors are labeled \u201ctime robbers,\u201d or time wasters, because they steal valuable time rather than promote effective time usage. Although these behaviors are listed separately, it should be noted that the personalities of some people include many of these behaviors, making effective time management even more elusive.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Don\u2019t\tworry;\tif\tit\ninjects\tlife\tinto\tthe\tconversation,\tyou\u2019ve\tdone\twell.

And just as a return to the beach may inspire you to pick up a new shell, which at another time seemed unattractive or banal, a new encounter with stress may entice you to select a new method of coping. This chapter outlines some additional coping techniques that are often used to deal with stress effectively. Although they may not serve as your \ufb01  rst line of defense in every case, at some point in your life you may \ufb01  nd them very helpful. Information Seeking\nFear of the unknown accompanies many formidable stressors, from job interviews to cancer diagnoses. Several circumstances we encounter are perceived as threats because of our lack of information about the event. Lack of information allows the mind to \ufb01  ll in missing pieces with hypothetical facts or worst-case scenarios, which often per-petuates the stress response. To conquer fear of the unknown, gathering information about a speci\ufb01  c circum-\nstance becomes one of the best defenses against stressors. Information seeking involves collecting and processing facts about a stressful event or situation, which can then be used to help solve the problem and regain emotional stabil-ity. As suggested by psychologist Shelly Taylor (2005), the gathering and processing of information also allows mas-tery of control because knowledge can become a powerful tool with which to confront and dismantle a stressor. Information seeking has been found to be an essential \nskill following diagnosis of terminal illness, in the recov-ery process of alcoholics and drug abusers, during preg-nancy, and for any other stressor that makes an unpredictable change in your life, however big or small. When encountering stress, people pose many questions in an attempt to gain a handle on the unknown.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>I still suck at talking to people\u201d).

Stress  with a Human Face\nThe train sched-ules are so pre-cise in Germany it is said that you \ncan set your watch by them. Bernhard not only sets his watch by the trains when he returns home to Frankfurt, but also keeps his eye on the plane schedule. Bernhard, you see, is an executive at Lufthansa Airlines, which itself has a pretty good eye on the time departure schedule. Bern-hard came to the United States to obtain his MBA. While in graduate school, he learned to master a precise time sched-ule that included his studies, family time with his baby boy Philip, and his arduous triathlon training, which in itself could be a full-time job. Bernhard\u2019s dream was to qualify and compete in the Hawaiian Ironman competition, a goal he accomplished in 1998. After returning home to Germany and taking a job with Lufthansa, he was soon transferred back to the United States to head up the company\u2019s North American regional headquarters.New York City is a far cry from Frankfurt, and it\u2019s fair to say that no one sets their watches by the New York sub-way schedule. In fact, there are constant jokes about what \u201ca New York min ute\u201d really is. Despite the culture shock, traf\ufb01  c, typical congestion, and repeated terror-ism alerts you would expect to \ufb01  nd in the Big Apple, Bernhard has adapted quite well. He organizes his affairs for the next day each night before he goes to bed.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>He had nothing to lose. With a de\ufb01  ant determination to recover and the sup-\nport of his personal physician, Cousins checked out of the hospital and into a nearby hotel. He acquired copies of humorous movies and TV shows, including those of Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers. One of his friends, Alan Funt, even sent some classic clips from his hit TV show Candid Camera. Cousins later wrote in his \nnow-famous book Anatomy of an Illness that \u201cten min-\nutes of laughter allowed two hours of pain-free sleep.\u201d After a time, he checked out of the hotel and went home; his disease had gone into remission. On the advice of his doctor, Cousins (1978) wrote up his story as a case history for the New England Journal of Medicine . Although he attributed his successful healing process to several factors, including large doses of vitamin C, the interpretation by those who read the article was that Cousins literally laughed himself back to health. Norman Cousins\u2019s story is now just one of many sup-\nporting the idea that positive emotions do indeed have healing effects on health. However, it was this single case study of comic relief, perhaps more than any other, that paved the road to a whole new \ufb01  eld of study called psycho neuroimmunology (PNI), and Cousins will always be remembered for his generous contribution to it. What has been learned since his hospital discharge is that positive emotions play an incredible role in main-taining the health of the human body. Humor therapy, or comic relief, is the use of humor to promote well-being through positive thoughts, attitudes, and emo-tions by counter balancing the deleterious effects of negative thoughts, perceptions, and emotions on one\u2019s health. Humor as a coping technique is not a panacea for all ills, but it does provide bene\ufb01  ts in a bad situation, whether in a hospital bed or outside a locked car, with your keys still in the ignition. Upon the death of legend-ary comic Bob Hope, who lived to be 100, his daughter, interviewed on Larry King Live, noted that comedians and musical composers tend to live longer than most, most likely because of having a positive attitude. Historical Perspective\nHumor is a human magnet: It attracts all ears and minds.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Circle them. Line them up like an army of troops. Once your ideas are out on the table, one or two are likely to jump out at you. You might also want to rank-order (judge) your ideas by degree of feasibility (plan A, plan B, plan C, and so on) because not every idea will work, and the idea that looks best now might \ufb02  op the hardest. Now bring in the artist again and manipulate your idea of choice. Manipulation means adapting the idea to \u201cbest \ufb01  t\u201d the problem. You may need to streamline the idea or to otherwise change it a little to suit your speci\ufb01  c needs. Once you have selected your \ufb01  rst choice, play it out in your mind. Visualize the idea. What are the pros and cons? Explore hypotheticals and look for potential weaknesses that could be corrected to avoid major pitfalls. Expect the unexpected. Now remember plan B and plan C. A person without options is a person in trouble, so you will want to have some back-ups. Give some thought to your second and third choices because there is a good chance you will someday use them. Once you have narrowed your ideas down to one choice, it is a good practice to do a quick inventory to see what resources it may require. Not all ideas require addi-tional resources, but many do. Remember that resources may include people as well as material goods, and don\u2019t overlook those intangible resources, the hidden talents within each individual. Idea Implementation\nImplementation takes bravery\u2014perhaps not much, but in the face of stress, maybe a lot. Implementation involves a game plan, a strategy. This means thinking about how the idea can be put into effect and end in res-olution. It means trying the idea out. In addition to bravery, implementation requires faith.

The Creative Process\nThe creative process is not complex, but it is wonder-\nfully profound because there are so many possible ways to get from point A to point B. During the 1980s, intense interest in the human creative process developed. And like the goose that was cut open to \ufb01  nd out how she laid the golden egg, the creative process has since been exam-ined from every side, angle, and perspective, and has been dissected and inspected. Unlike the goose, though, the process wasn\u2019t killed; instead, it has become well understood so that the creative muscle could \ufb02  ex with \nstrength, power, and agility for the whim and bene\ufb01  t of \nthose anxious to use it. The creative process has two parts, which by no coinci-\ndence match the functions of the right and left hemi-spheres of the human brain. Remember that Maslow (1987) observed a number of characteristics contributing to total well-being, or as he called it, self-actualization. Creativity was among these characteristics. In his later work on self-actualization, Maslow concluded that the creative process and the path to self-actualization were one and the same. He called the creative process the \u201cart of being happily lost in the present moment.\u201d He divided the creative process into primary and secondary parts. Primary creativity is the origin of ideas: the playground of the mind where ideas are generated and hatched. Secondary creativity describes the strategic plan to bring to fruition the ideas brought forth in primary creativity. Secondary creativity is like the mind\u2019s workshop: a place to saw, chisel, glue, hammer, and polish ideas. Players on the Creativity Team\nCreative consultant Roger von Oech took Maslow\u2019s idea one step further, dividing primary and secondary creativ-ity each into two phases. In his celebrated book from 1986, A Kick in the Seat of the Pants , von Oech\u2019s model of creative \nthinking includes a team of four players\u2014the explorer, artist, judge, and warrior. The explorer and artist provide \nprimary creativity, and the judge and warrior provide sec-ondary creativity. The explorer and artist team together for what von Oech calls the germination phase of creativ-ity. In this phase, inspiration and imagination are used to their fullest potential. The germination phase involves soft, pliable, right-brain thinking. Examples of this think-ing style include irrationality, nonlinear perceptions, syn-thesis, metaphor, dreams, humor, and global awareness. The judge and warrior join forces in the harvesting of the creative crops sowed in the depths of imagination. The harvest phase of creativity involves hard, critical, left-brain thinking. Examples include logic, rationality, linear anal-ysis, and factual thinking. Each type of thinking style has an equal responsibility in the creative process. The key is to let each player do its job without inter ference from the other three. In the footsteps of von Oech, Charles M. Johnson, founder of the Institute for Creative Develop-ment, delineates the creative process as a combination of creative differentiation and creative integration. Like von Oech, he divides the creative process into four stages: (1) incubation, (2) inspiration, (3) perspiration, and (4) administration (Johnson, 2005). The overall goal of creative thought is to sharpen the \nskills of all four team players so that one or two aspects don\u2019t overpower the others, cause them to atrophy, and sti\ufb02 e the entire process. Let us take a more detailed look \nat the members of the creative team. Primary creativity: Maslow\u2019s term for the \ufb01  rst \nstage of the creative process in which ideas are \nconceived. Secondary creativity: Maslow\u2019s term for the last \nstage of the creative process in which a strategy is played out to have the selected idea come to fruition. Explorer: Von Oech\u2019s term to identify the \ufb01  rst stage \nof the creative process in which one begins to look \nfor new ideas by venturing outside one\u2019s comfort level. Artist: Von Oech\u2019s term to identify the second stage \nof the creative process, in which one plays with or incubates ideas that the explorer has brought back. Judge: Von Oech\u2019s term to identify the third stage \nof the creative process, in which one selects the best idea and prepares it for manifestation. Warrior: The last stage in von Oech\u2019s creative pro-\ncess template, in which the idea is taken to the street and campaigned to the rest of the world for its merits. 56147_CH13_280_292.indd   28356147_CH13_280_292.indd   283 9/30/08   8:08:17 AM9/30/08   8:08:17 AMChapter 13\n284The Explorer.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Are\tthe\tshoulders\tslouched\tor\theld\tnaturally\tupright?

The greater the quantity of laughs and the quality of humor, the greater the sensation of pleasure. The long-term effects of comic relief as a coping mechanism at best remain a mystery, particularly because these have not been investigated to any great degree. In a study conducted at the headquar-ters of the United States Postal Service, a humor course was offered to a select group of employees. Meeting once a week during the noon hour for a month, participants were exposed to both theories of humor therapy and sev-eral comedy videos and cassette tapes (Seaward, Meholick, and Campanelli, 1992). Participants were measured, by means of questionnaires, to evaluate self-esteem prior to and after the completion of the course, as well as per-ceived stress before and after each session. Results revealed that exposure to humorous material seemed to have the immediate effect of decreasing perceived stress levels, but apparently had no signi\ufb01  cant prolonged effect on self-esteem, indicating that humor therapy is most effective in dealing with current perceptions and their related emotions.

And just as a return to the beach may inspire you to pick up a new shell, which at another time seemed unattractive or banal, a new encounter with stress may entice you to select a new method of coping. This chapter outlines some additional coping techniques that are often used to deal with stress effectively. Although they may not serve as your \ufb01  rst line of defense in every case, at some point in your life you may \ufb01  nd them very helpful. Information Seeking\nFear of the unknown accompanies many formidable stressors, from job interviews to cancer diagnoses. Several circumstances we encounter are perceived as threats because of our lack of information about the event. Lack of information allows the mind to \ufb01  ll in missing pieces with hypothetical facts or worst-case scenarios, which often per-petuates the stress response. To conquer fear of the unknown, gathering information about a speci\ufb01  c circum-\nstance becomes one of the best defenses against stressors. Information seeking involves collecting and processing facts about a stressful event or situation, which can then be used to help solve the problem and regain emotional stabil-ity. As suggested by psychologist Shelly Taylor (2005), the gathering and processing of information also allows mas-tery of control because knowledge can become a powerful tool with which to confront and dismantle a stressor. Information seeking has been found to be an essential \nskill following diagnosis of terminal illness, in the recov-ery process of alcoholics and drug abusers, during preg-nancy, and for any other stressor that makes an unpredictable change in your life, however big or small.

This activity de\ufb01  nitely taught me a lot about myself, how I view others, and what makes me tick. The main thing this journal taught me was that I care about others\u2019 feelings more than I let on. I think that I have more of a sensitive side than most guys would admit to, but this is by no means a bad thing. I looked at my values, which is something that I hadn\u2019t done in a long while, and realized I needed to focus more on the values that I was raised with than the val-ues of my friends. I also looked back and saw that I have a great distaste for violence against another human being. I strongly believe that violence is a way for people who don\u2019t know how to deal with their stress properly to relieve themselves of this perceived negativity. These exercises really made me examine myself and look \nat how I was, and how I want to strive to be.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>b. The Pareto principle states that 20 percent of \nthe tasks we do give 80 percent of the rewards or satisfaction (Reh, 2008). Also referred to as the 80/20 Rule, this principle suggests that in-dividuals should focus on one or two signi\ufb01  -\ncant tasks that are worth the time invested in them. According to this principle, out of every ten responsibilities listed, only two will pro-duce recognizable gains. These tasks should be given attention and time. (These two tasks will most likely fall in the A category, suggest-ing that completion of C, and even B, items may prove unfruitful in the long run.)\nc. Sometimes it is dif\ufb01  cult to differentiate among \nresponsibilities, all of which seem important, what to do \ufb01\n rst. One answer is to employ \nStephen Covey\u2019s important-versus-urgent \nmethod (Box 15.1) as highlighted in his best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Divide your responsibilities for the day (or week) into four boxes. Note that peo-ple tend to direct their energies toward box IV (Not urgent, Not important) because these responsibilities look quick, easy, and perhaps enjoyable. Covey suggests that one\u2019s overrid-ing attention should go to the box labeled II (Important but not Urgent) because this will yield the highest results. Box I (Important and Urgent) needs adequate time, but this is not where the majority of your attention should be placed, for it will only lead to a reactionary lifestyle. Covey suggests that it\u2019s not time that needs to be managed but ourselves that need attention. Quadrant II is the key to effective personal management. 2.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

In the year 1260, a pro-gressive French physician, Henri de Moundeville, saw the important relationship between positive emotions and sound health, and made a practice of allowing fam-ily and friends to cheer and joke with their sick rela-tives. He wrote, \u201cLet the surgeon take care to regulate the whole regimen of the patient\u2019s life for joy and hap-piness.\u201d European monarchs also saw the importance of laughter, and often employed court jesters (those guys with funny shoes) to add mirth to their castle courts. Perhaps the most renowned court jester was Richard Tarlton, who was credited with keeping British Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603) in better health than did her team of physicians. But laughter has not always been looked upon with \nfavor. Europeans in the Middle Ages and Puritans on the eastern shores of North America, among others, perceived laughter to be the work of the devil. People caught laughing out loud were often denounced as witches or believed to be possessed by Satan. The expres-sion of humor was considered a sin in many Christian denominations. Other comments from those days about laughter (Moody, 1978):\nLaughter on any occasion is immoral and indecent. Laughter obscures truth, hardens the heart, and stu-pe\ufb01 es understanding. A man of parts of fashion is therefore only seen to smile, but never heard to laugh. \u2014Lord Chester\ufb01  eld, 1748\nAnd if you look at the portraits of European nobility \ncommissioned over a period of several hundred years, you are hard-pressed to \ufb01  nd anyone smiling (except perhaps the Mona Lisa).

Psychologists use the term self-ful\ufb01  lling prophecy  to \ndescribe the link between perceptions/beliefs and their \nrelated behaviors. The self-ful\ufb01  lling prophecy can work to one\u2019s advantage as well as one\u2019s disadvantage. Sports events are \ufb01  lled with stories of athletes who believed they were winners and proved that indeed they were. In highly competitive events like the Olympics, the differ-ence between a gold medal and a silver or bronze is not only a super lative athletic body, but an accompanying winning attitude. Many an athlete has lost an event, and thus failed to meet an expectation, because a seed of self-doubt took root somewhere between the starting block and the \ufb01  nish line. Individuals who harbor negative thoughts about themselves or the situations they encoun-ter promote behaviors generated by these perceptions. The result can be a negative cycle that sets the stage for recurring stressful perceptions and what appears to be a stagnant black cloud over one\u2019s head; this is the ful\ufb01  ll-\nment of the self-ful\ufb01  lling prophecy. An example of this concept occurred in the 1990 hit movie Pretty Woman, when actress Julia Roberts, in the role of a Hollywood hooker, described to actor Richard Gere how she fell into her \u201ccareer rut.\u201d She stated that while grow-ing up she received a lot of negative feedback from her parents and peers, and that these were so much easier to believe, eroding her self-esteem.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>The recognition of this importance reveals vari-ous aspects of one\u2019s psychic landscape. And, as much can be revealed by what is not drawn as by what is pic-torially represented. For instance, in self-portraits, peo-ple who draw faces with no mouths or ears suggest an inability to express their feelings verbally. Long arms may express a desire to reach out for help or affection. Short arms may signify feelings of withdrawal. Short necks indicate stubbornness. Boxed shoulders hint of the inability to let matters roll off the back. According to art therapist Evelyn Virshup (1978), the \nimportance of art therapy is in the process, not necessarily the outcome. The expression of oneself through art far exceeds the aesthetic quality to the viewer: \u201cSomeone who is asked to draw how they feel, and is then measured by the yardstick of aesthetics will feel betrayed, and will repress further feelings. Creativity of expression is sti\ufb02  ed \nby judgmental evaluation.\u201d A crucial factor in the prac-tice of art therapy is the collaborative verbal description of the picture once it has been drawn. The role of the art therapist is to guide the artist through his or her under-standing of each work. This is done by asking open-ended questions such as, What does the picture mean? In many cases, the artist may not overtly recognize the emo-tional signi\ufb01  cance of the work (e.g., missing features, sig-ni\ufb01 cant color selection, or disproportional \ufb01  gures) or may \nnot be quite ready to accept verbally what has been depicted graphically. Art therapists suggest that, upon completion of the drawing, the artist try to explain what the \ufb01  gure represents, perhaps even to write it down on the corner of the drawing. This serves to balance the non-verbal expression with the verbal expression and further the communication process of the conscious and uncon-scious minds.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Ring the bell and \n run, he hates that.

Cousins certainly was not the \ufb01  rst person to use humor as a cop-ing technique. Comic relief has been pondered since men and women \ufb01  rst tickled their funny bones. The \nancient Greeks held humor as a virtue. The philosopher Plato, for instance, believed humor nurtured the soul, and he advocated its use as a healing practice (Shelley, 2003). From the ancient Greeks came the formulas for theater, including comedy, still used today. And as far back as Old Testament times, people in the Middle East believed \u201cA merry heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones\u201d (Proverbs 17:22). In fact, humor as a \u201chealing medicine\u201d can be found at the root of virtually every culture on the globe, from the earliest practices of the native peoples of Africa to those of the Americas. It seems that humor and the viruses it helps to \ufb01  ght are equally contagious.

Pursue your hobbies as a way to meet people\nWhen y ou\u2019re in university , you can meet lots of friends through your\nclasses, living arrangements, and part-time jobs. If you m eet anyone\nthrough a hobby , it\u2019 s almost a bonus. After college is over , your interests\nbecome a lot more central to your social life. People who have a lot of\nsocial hobbies have an easier time making friends. If they\u2019re settling down\nin a new city , it \u2019 s natural for th em to join a bunch of teams, get involved\nwith a theater g roup, or start v olunteering somewhere. Before long, they\nhave a social circle. It\u2019 s harder for people who have more solita ry interests\nlike reading, watching movies, or going for long hikes by themselves. Consider getting  some more soc ial hobbies if you don\u2019 t already  have any . Y ou don \u2019 t need to totally overhaul your personality or all of yo ur pastimes,\nbut tweak how you spend your  time so you can meet as man y friends as\nyou\u2019d lik e. Do more activities o utside of the house. Find a way to use your\nexisting hobbies to put you in contact with more people. For example, if\nyou normally exercise at home, join a class or running club. If you like\nreading about new ideas, attend some free talks or seminars, or join a book\ndiscussion club. If you like stand-up comedy , see if there are any Internet\nmeet-ups where fans can arrange to go to shows together . Be mor e active about seizing opportunities with potential friendsWhen you\u2019re in college, you can af ford to be a bit lazy about making\nfriends. If you meet someone yo u get along with in one of your  classes but\ndon\u2019 t pursue the relationship as hard as you could have, it\u2019 s no t the end of\nthe world. Y ou\u2019ll probably see them again in the next eight weeks. And if it\ndoesn\u2019 t work out with them, there are tons of other prospects. When you\u2019re\nno longe r in college, the opportu nities don\u2019 t pop up as often. Y ou have to be\na little more on top of things when it comes to following up with people you\nhit it of f with. Sure, at your job or at the start  of a league\u2019 s season, you can drag your\nfeet, but  there will often be tim es when you\u2019ll meet a possible friend only\nonce or twice, and if you don\u2019 t jump on the chance, you\u2019ll lose it. A lot of\nhobby-related ve nues like dance classes or rock-climbing gyms have people\nwho onl y drop in a handful of times and then move on. When  you meet a\nperson y ou coul d imagine yourself being friends with and there\u2019 s a chance\nyou may not cross paths with them again, be more active about getting their\ncontact information. Then follow up on the lead fairly quickly . Expand the range of people you could possibly be friends with\nWhen y ou\u2019re sti ll in high schoo l and college, you mostly form friendships\nwith peo ple arou nd your age an d from a similar background. A s you move\nthrough adultho od, the range of  people you meet and could hang out with\nincreases. Don\u2019 t  be too quick to dismiss someone who\u2019 s older or younger\nbecause they don\u2019 t fit what you imagined your social circle would look like. Just bec ause so meone\u2019 s age is a decade up or down from yo urs doesn\u2019 t\nautomatically mean you have nothing in common, or that they\u2019 re silly and\nimmature, or stodgy and out of touch. Don\u2019 t assume someone with a\ndif ferent background is from a totally dif ferent world and cou ld never be\ninto the same things you are.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Clothing. Styles of clothing send very strong mes-sages about personal values, attitudes, and behav-iors, and may or may not meet the expectations of other individuals in one\u2019s environments. Profes-sional settings, for example, call for a particular style of clothing. That which deviates from the expected or normal dress code can communicate anything from ignorance, to disrespect, to a rebel-lious attitude. Knowing that communication involves both verbal and nonverbal messages, it is important to recognize and utilize elements of both to make your style of communi-cation as effective as possible. Recognition and utiliza-tion of effective verbal and nonverbal skills require, speci\ufb01  cally, listening, attending, and responding skills. Listening, Attending, and \nResponding Skills\nThe process of communication is like the two sides of a \ncoin. The \ufb01  rst side represents self-expression; the second, listening. You have probably heard someone say, \u201cHe heard me, but he didn\u2019t listen to what I said!\u201d Hearing is the reception of auditory sensations, whereas listening is \nthe understanding of these auditory sensations. Research \nshows that in a typical day more than 50 percent of com-munication involves listening (Burley-Allen, 1995). Under closer observation, however, individuals show a general complacency about listening and attending skills; they may hear, but they do not listen very well. In the words of Tannen (2001), \u201cCommunication is a system. Everything that is said is simultaneously an instigation and reaction, a reaction and an instigation. Most of us tend to focus on the \ufb01  rst part of that process while ignor-ing or downplaying the second.\u201d Typically, in conversa-tion, when people \ufb01  nish expressing a thought or feeling, they almost immediately begin to prepare their next statement, listening only to the \ufb01  rst couple of words of \nresponse. The most common example occurs during introductions, when a new person states his or her name while you prepare to say yours. Seconds later, you cannot remember what the person\u2019s name is. As a rule, the con-centration required for listening is very tiring. The key elements involved in effective listening, attend-\ning, and responding are the following:\n 1. Assume the role of listener.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>You can begin by asking \u201cWhat if \u201d questions (and not all of these have turned out to be dumb!).

Performing in a play may help you\ndeal with your nerves and fear of being on the spot. Improv tea ches you to\nbe more  loose, playful, and spontaneous in your conversations. Many\npeople a lso find  they get a small confidence boost in their daily interactions\nfrom knowing they\u2019re getting the hang of a more intimidatin g skill like\nspeaking in public. Y ou don\u2019 t have to spend a lot of time talking to strangers in  public to\npractice your social skills. Some people think they have to chat with a\nbunch o f random s at the mall or grocery store. If you\u2019re specifically trying\nto get used to starting and carrying on conversations with people you don\u2019 t\nknow , that\u2019 s one thing. If you generally want to rack up s ome social\nexperience, talk ing to strangers is usually too stressful and ine f ficient.

I n d i r e c t l y  i m p r o v i n g  y o u r  s o c i a l  s u c c e s s\nA lthough directly addressing the less-practiced aspects of your social skills\nis essen tial, you  can also indire ctly help your cause by becom ing a more\nwell-rounded, knowledgeable, interesting person. This works in a \u201cwax on,\nwax of f \u201d kind of way . Imagine you did nothing to directly p ractice your\nsocial skills for three months, but spent that time traveling, discovering new\nmusic, and learning to mountain bike. At the end of those three months,\nmany social situations would likely go more smoothly for you. Y ou\u2019d have\nmore to  talk about and relate to people over , and you\u2019d really notice a\ndif ference if you ended up in a conversation with a traveler , cyclist, or\nmusic fan. The struggles of trav eling and learning to mountain bike wouldhave increased your overall confidence or maybe made you more fun and\nadventurous. The experiences you had on vacation may have some cachet\nand make people want to chat  more with you so they could learn more\nabout them. That\u2019 s n ot to say that if you pick up a bunch of new hobbies, you\u2019ll be\nable to duck out of the direct practice requirement. Also, some people hear\nthis advice and they try to learn about and do everything, hoping to get the\nmaximum social benefit.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Don\u2019 t mumble or talk into your chest. Don\u2019 t speak too quickly in a rush to get your point out or not take up\ntoo much time. Be reasonably concise. Know what you want to get across, rather\nthan rambling on. T ry to cut down on filler words and sounds such as \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n(if you need a moment to think, being silent for a split second is\nbetter). Everyone uses filler words sometimes, but overdoing it can\nmake you seem ditzy . Overall expr essivenessIn addition to your facial expressions, expressiveness comes from varying\nyour voice and t he gestures you make. If your face is always a blank mask,\nyou speak in a monotone, and you don\u2019 t move your hands or body much,\nyou\u2019ll seem flat and bored, and  be hard to read. On the other hand, being\noverly e xpressive and animate d can make you seem fake, flighty , or\nagitated. Aim to hit whatever the typical level of expressiveness is for yo ur culture. If y ou\u2019re under -expressive, you \u2019ll have to consciously force yourself to\ngesture more often and put on a smile when you want to seem cheerful. More than with many of these points, this feels very clunky and unnatural at\nfirst, but showing a wider range of emotion will feel more normal in time. Again, as you get more comfortable in your own skin, y ou\u2019ll likely\nnaturally start to be more expre ssive. If you\u2019re over -expressive you\u2019ll need\nto do  the  opposi te and tone dow n your gestures and facial expre ssions. This\ncan also  feel artificial and restrictive at first, but will become easier with\ntime. Body language\nIn d ay-to-day social situations,  you want body language that makes you\nseem relatively confident, relaxed, friendly , approachable, and happy . This\ninvolves\nhaving open body language;\nholding yourself in a loose, non-tense, and non-rigid way;\nabsence of nervous or fidgety gestures like rubbing your hands on\nyour pants or tapping your foot;\nabsence of unintentionally bored or disrespectful-seeming actions,\nlike looking around the room or fiddling with nearby objects. Y ou want your body languag e to seem self-assured, but c asual andrelaxed. If you c ome of f as over ly confident, you will seem like you belong\nat a sales convention, not a ho-hum social gathering. Y ou also d on\u2019 t want to\nveer into confrontational or overly dominant territory (that is, standing with\nyour che st puf fe d out, body to o rigid and rooted in place, hands planted\ndefiantly on your hips, invading  other people\u2019 s space, or resting  your hands\non peop le\u2019 s sho ulders). Sure, maybe you\u2019ll need to act like that if you\u2019re\nliving in a rough neighborhood where only the strong survive. But in most\nsocial situations , that kind of body language will either mak e you look\nangry and unstable, or like you\u2019 re a jerk who\u2019 s trying too hard t o be the top\ndog at the expense of connecting with people in a friendlier way . Postur e\nThe most attractive, confident p osture is when you\u2019re standing u pright with\nyour head and s houlders back, though not in a standing-at-attention way . There ar e two main types of poor posture. The first is slouch ing\u2014when\nyour sh oulders are hunched and rounded, and your head juts too far\nforward. The second is  ante rior pelvic tilt , wh ich makes y ou look like yo u\nhave a potbelly , even if you\u2019re thin. This poor posture occurs when your\nhips tilt too far downward and your lower back arches too far inward,\ncausing your butt and stomach to stick out.

Linguistic experts divide verbal communication into two compo-nents: encoding and decoding. Encoding is the process wherein a speaker attempts to frame thoughts and per-ceptions into words (e.g., someone saying to the person next to her, \u201cBoy, it\u2019s stuffy in here\u201d). Decoding is the \nprocess wherein the message is translated, dissected, analyzed, and interpreted by the listener (e.g., the per-son hearing this thinks, \u201cYeah, the room does smell rather gamey\u201d).

The greater the quantity of laughs and the quality of humor, the greater the sensation of pleasure. The long-term effects of comic relief as a coping mechanism at best remain a mystery, particularly because these have not been investigated to any great degree. In a study conducted at the headquar-ters of the United States Postal Service, a humor course was offered to a select group of employees. Meeting once a week during the noon hour for a month, participants were exposed to both theories of humor therapy and sev-eral comedy videos and cassette tapes (Seaward, Meholick, and Campanelli, 1992). Participants were measured, by means of questionnaires, to evaluate self-esteem prior to and after the completion of the course, as well as per-ceived stress before and after each session. Results revealed that exposure to humorous material seemed to have the immediate effect of decreasing perceived stress levels, but apparently had no signi\ufb01  cant prolonged effect on self-esteem, indicating that humor therapy is most effective in dealing with current perceptions and their related emotions.

I recommend that you try all the following coping \ntechniques when and where appropriate.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Avoid manipulation. In the course of asserting yourself, you may \ufb01  nd that others may consciously \nor unconsciously try to block your efforts to accomplish resolution. The following are some roadblocks of manipulation to be aware of, as well as some suggested strategies that may help to dismantle them:\na. Intimidation. Asserting yourself may intimi-\ndate others who are in the habit of using ma-\nnipulation and control to get their way. They in turn may raise their voices and display their tempers. When you recognize this behavior, you can defuse it by saying that you want to hold off further discussion of this issue until the other person calms down. For example, \u201cI can see that you are quite angry; let\u2019s talk about this after lunch.\u201d\nb. Content substitution. Sometimes people will \ndraw peripheral issues into a discussion to derail the issue at hand. If you become aware that the concern you brought up has become lost in tangential issues, quickly shift focus back to the original topic until your issue has been put to rest. c. Personal attacks (character assassination). You \nmay \ufb01  nd that in an attempt to resolve an issue, \nthe person you are talking to comes back at you with a character \ufb02\n aw. One way to get \nback on track is to agree, in part, about the character \ufb02  aw and ignore the rest. Davis calls this response clouding, the attempt to de\ufb02  ect \nan attack by concurring with some part of it. When employing this technique, rephrase the attack in your best interest, and get back to the issue at hand.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

But to be creative takes the right attitude and a workable strat-egy. The ability to be creative resides within each and every one of us. Creativity is not a gift\u2014it is a human birthright. But like muscles that atrophy with disuse, creativity must be exercised to be effective. For those of you who have let your creative abilities slip into hiber-nation, here is a refresher course in the basics. Julia Cameron is convinced that creativity is truly a \nbirthright for each individual. In her book The Artist\u2019s Way, Cameron states that because of a series of factors found in American society, we have, in essence, not just dulled the edge of our creative abilities, we have buried them. But what is lost can certainly be recovered, if not discovered, by reacquainting ourselves with the creative juices that course through our human veins. Cameron insists that the creative process is a spiritual one, and that to engage in the creative process invites us to par-ticipate as co-creators with that aspect of the divine self. Connecting with what she calls \u201cspiritual electricity,\u201d Cameron invites people to step outside the left-brain way of thinking and unite both hemispheres of thought when calling upon the creative forces to solve problems or to enjoy life in its fullness. Quoting sources from Johannes Brahms and Louis Armstrong to Louis Pasteur and Carl Jung (who all give credit to a divine co-partnership in innovativeness), Cameron illustrates a tapestry of creative skills that is available to everyone.

Behaviors associated with \npoor health are those most often targeted for change. I Personality is thought to be made up primarily of val-\nues, those abstract qualities that give meaning to our lives; attitudes, perceptions derived from these values; and behaviors, any actions based on one or more atti-tudes.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>There are usually multiple ways to handle any situation.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This is neither real-istic nor healthy. Emotional well-being is the ability to feel and express the full range of human emotions, both \npositive and negative. The danger lies in the imbalance of positive and negative emotions because a preponder-ance of the latter will ultimately in\ufb02  ict bodily damage. Cousins highlighted humor as a symbol of all the posi-tive emotions that can lend themselves to emotional well-being. Use humor therapy to \ufb01  nd and maintain \nthat balance of human emotions in your life. 56147_CH12_258_279.indd   27656147_CH12_258_279.indd   276 9/29/08   11:09:22 PM9/29/08   11:09:22 PM277 Humor Therapy (Comic Relief)\n277I Cousins legitimized the use of humor therapy when \nhe treated himself with hours of funny \ufb01  lms, which \ncontributed to the remission of his potentially fatal \ndisease. The premise of the therapy was that if nega-tive thoughts can result in illness and disease, posi-tive thoughts should enhance health. Cousins also believed that for his health to return he had to take personal responsibility for it. I Greeks advocated humor therapy more than \n2,000 years ago, as did ancient Africans, American Indians, and medieval European kings and queens. However, laughter was declared by the Puritans to be the work of the devil, and to laugh or smile was considered a sin.

The organization of a cancer-support group called ECaP was developed for what Siegel called the \u201cexceptional cancer patient,\u201d one who employs hope, love, faith, and even humor to deal with his or her ill-ness. Siegel was quick to point out that death is the \ufb01  nal \noutcome for everyone; yet from his experience, he observed that a positive attitude made the transition much easier regardless of when death occurs. Is it really possible to change the programming in our \nminds to break the habit of negative thinking? According to Richard Bandler and John Grinder (Andreas and Faulkven, 1994), the answer is a de\ufb01  nitive yes! Years ago, Bandler, a psychologist, and Grinder, a linguist, combined their efforts to create and teach the theory and application of changing our mental language. They called it neurolin-guistic programming (NLP). The premise of NLP is based on the concept of uncovering hidden grammar woven in the unconscious and conscious thoughts of our vernacular, systematically removing these expressions as we think or speak, and learning to develop a language of af\ufb01 rmative thoughts to positively change the direction of \nour lives. NLP is an empowering skill to reprogram the software of human linguistics so that our human energies can be focused in the direction of our highest human poten-tial or human excellence. Part sel ective awareness, part self-hypnosis, the dynamics of NLP work to eliminate the self-defeating thoughts that inhibit our energies and keep us from reaching our goals. Over the years, NLP has proven quite successful and is used by athletes, actors, executives, business associates, lawyers, and professionals from all walks of life. By encouraging reprogramming and eliminating from daily vernacular words, phrases, and thoughts that reinforce stress-prone behaviors, NLP helps one to unlearn old thoughts and learn a new approach toward optimal  excellence. NLP Comprehensive, based in Boulder, Colorado, offers seminars and workshops in the dyna mics of NLP. Understanding that one cannot change behaviors quickly as a result of a one- or two-day workshop, the NLP training coaches participants through a 21-day Achievement Program to help decondition and reprogram the human thought process. Far more than lauding creative and optimistic thinking \nstyles, Western culture rewards and praises critical think-ing, the ability to judge and analyze situations, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>I has enough faith in herself to see her through \na crisis.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "4.

Y ou have to use them in\nmoderation.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>If you go to a big party or networking event, it\nwouldn\u2019 t be unusual to chat wit h a dozen or more people over t he evening. On the downsid e, if you\u2019re go ing to have trouble in a conversation, it\u2019 s\nlikely go ing to be in those first c ouple of minutes. There are two  reasons for\nthis: First, if som eone doesn\u2019 t feel like speaking to you or you don\u2019 t have\nmuch to say to each other , that\u2019 s going to become clear quickly . The other\nperson w on\u2019 t give you much to  work with, or you\u2019ll both struggle to find\nsomething to talk about. Rem ember , there\u2019 s no way to en sure every\ninteraction you have will go w ell. Second, you\u2019re usually feeling at your\nmost ne rvous an d on the spot when you\u2019re first talking to someone, and\nanxiety can cause you or your c onversation partner to stall. If you can get\npast that point, the rest of the conversation is usually easier . It\u2019 s grea t when you find an interesting subject to talk about right away , but\nit\u2019 s not at all unusual for a conv ersation to be a little stilted in its opening\nminutes. That\u2019 s no reason to panic. This awkwardness isn\u2019 t a sign that the\ninteraction won\u2019 t be enjoyable o r that you have horrible people skills. It justmeans that each person hasn\u2019 t found their footing yet. In a few minutes,\neveryone may be feeling more comfortable and have found something fun\nto talk about. Sometimes a conversation you start may peter out soon after it begins. Knowing this takes some of the pressure away . Every time you talk to\nsomeone, realiz e that they may be preoccupied, have nothing in common\nwith you, or be  too shy to think of anything to say . Also accept that\nsometimes you just won\u2019 t be on your game and able to do your part to keep\nthe conv ersation moving. Have a plan for gracefully leaving a conversation\nthat isn\u2019 t going anywhere. Rather than panicking and blaming yourself,\nkeep your cool and move on. (Chapter 13 covers how to end conversations.)\nG e n e r a l  g u i d e l i n e s  f o r  s t a r t i n g  c o n v e r s a t i o n s\nThe app ropriate ways to initiate a conversation vary depending on the\nsituation you\u2019re  in. If you\u2019re at a friend\u2019 s party , it\u2019 s expected that people\nwill talk to each other , and most of the guests are there to do just that. It\u2019 s\nfine to start con versations in a more forward, familiar , casual  way where\nyou act as if yo u\u2019re already on good terms with everyone. In m ore formal\nsettings, like a career networking event, you should be a little more reserved\nand mannered. Still be friendly , but don\u2019 t be overly casual or chummy right\nof f the bat. T alking to strangers in public pl aces during the day is on the ot her end of\nthe s pectrum. Some people are open to talking, but others are going about\ntheir day  and have other priorities. Read their body language for clues about\nhow open they may be to interacting with you (see Chapter 18). If they\nseem really preoccupied and c losed of f, it may be better to leave them\nalone. Y ou need  to respect that they may initially be wary and not know\nwhat you want from them or not be in the mood to talk. Y ou may need to\nget their attention with a smile or an \u201cexcuse me\u201d first. Still be friendly , butspeak w ith them  in a more pulled-back, noncommittal way to gi ve them the\nsense that you\u2019ll back of f if they don\u2019 t want to chat. Know your city and country\u2019 s at titude about what\u2019 s considered acceptable\ntoo. In some areas, people are constantly , cheerfully talking to each other in\ngrocery store lines, while in other places, the culture is \u201cDon\u2019 t intrude on\nanyone\u2019 s space. \u201d If your culture is less talkative, it doesn\u2019 t mean you\u2019ll\nnever be  able to speak to anyone you don\u2019 t know . If you try , yo u just need\nto be extra respectful and realize you won\u2019 t always get a warm response. Public places where people go specifically to socialize, like nightclubs,\nfall in between. Y ou have implicit permission to try to strike up a\nconversation with people you don\u2019 t know , and you can ofte n be more\ncasual; h owever , you also have to respect that not everyone goes to those\nplaces looking to chat with a b unch of strangers.

Her \ufb01 rst \ufb01  ndings were published in 1947; however, it took \nseveral more years for her theory to take root. Naumburg\u2019s theory dealt primarily with the unconscious expression of nonverbal thoughts as an important tool in psychoanaly-sis. She proposed that with the interpretive help of a ther-apist, the patients\u2019 artwork would aid in their own treatment and recovery. A second theory, developed by art teacher Edith Kramer \nin 1971, suggested that the process of drawing itself was therapeutic, and that more attention should be given to the creative, cathartic process than to the \ufb01  nal product, \nthe illustration. Since its inception as a discipline, many theories have been added to the study of art therapy, based on the foundation by Naumberg and Kramer. The role of the art therapist has also matured in this evolution. Originally seen as the primary vehicle for interpretation of the artist\u2019s work, the art therapist is now viewed as a blend of artist, therapist, and teacher. The art therapist serves as a catalyst to help the artist uncover his or her \nArt therapy: A coping technique of self-expression \nand self-awareness employing various media to describe feelings and thoughts in ways that verbal language cannot.

According to art therapist Eleanor Ulman (1961), the role of an art therapist is \u201cto help peo-ple bring out from within themselves a source of motiva-tion\u2014the wish to organize the experience of their inner and outer worlds into a coherent form.\u201d\nNot until the 1960s did art therapy emerge as its own \ndiscipline, with specialists becoming trained and certi-\ufb01 ed in the theoretical basis and application of this type \nof therapy. In 1969, the American Art Therapy Association was established. Originally, in its most clin-ical form, art therapy was designed as a diagnostic tool used by art therapists and psychologists to understand personality development and self-expression of patients with clinical disorders. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, art therapy became recognized and accepted as a coping technique for all individuals to increase self-awareness as well as act as an outlet for emotional expression. Cur rently, the bene\ufb01  ts of visual expression \nthrough various art media are acknowledged for every-one. To date, research in the \ufb01  eld of art therapy consists mostly of clinical case studies\u2014that is, individuals, who, in their recovery process, have attained a breakthrough in self-discovery through creative art. Conventional wisdom indicates that art therapy initiates a stronger partnership between the nonverbal, artistic, and spatial right-brain functions and the analytical, logical, and verbal left-brain functions. With the evidence gathered from split-brain research, it has now become obvious that the optimal human potential involves balance and integration of the right and left cognitive functions of the brain. As the discipline of art therapy continues to expand beyond the clinical setting, a greater under-standing of its bene\ufb01  ts will be realized. Today, art therapy is recognized for its many therapeutic \neffects on aspects of mental, physical, spiritual, and, most notably, emotional well-being. Art therapists agree that there are several goals associated with this technique to enhance the healing process and well-being. As described by art therapist Myra Levick (1983), these include:\n 1. To provide a means for strengthening the ego: to \nallow a better sense of identity through discovery of personal interests and growth issues\n 2. To provide a cathartic experience: to let emotions that have an immobilizing effect be released in the physical act of creating personal expression through art 3. To provide a means to uncover anger : to employ the \nuse of colors and shapes to express and detect feel-ings of aggression\n 4. To offer an avenue to reduce guilt: by conveying inner thoughts of past feelings and behavior asso-ciated with the guilt process\n 5.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>They\ndon\u2019 t complain that often, and even when they talk about their problems,\nthey don\u2019 t let t heir ener gy get too negative.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>At the end of each semester, I am told repeatedly by students that the creativity exercise was the best thing they ever did because it taught them they really could be creative. Don\u2019t Be Foolish\nHave you ever dropped your tray in the cafeteria, walked around all day with your \ufb02  y open, made a pre-sentation with food stuck in your teeth, or locked your keys in the car? The embarrassment resulting from such episodes is painful to the ego. Being foolish is thought of as being stupid, and stupidity earns no points in the game of life. We are so cautious about making mistakes for fear of how we will look in public that we constantly keep our guard up. But guarded behavior promotes conformity, and conformity breeds staleness. In the creative process, this mentality can lead to a con-cept called groupthink, where everyone conforms, goes along with the crowd. Groupthink is dangerous; it sti-\ufb02 es creativity. Sometimes it is necessary to be foolish. A \ngiddy outlook gives a new perspective on a situation. Playing the fool can augment the role of the judge to determine the worth of ideas. Being foolish can also mean having a sense of humor, and humor and creativ-ity make wonderful partners (see Chapter 12). To Err Is Wrong\nThere are times when making a mistake is not a good idea. It may cost you your job, marriage, or life. Then again, there are times when making a mistake may result in the most appropriate course of action. Mistakes offer invaluable learning experiences. In the creative process, mistakes are necessary. Each mistake bush-whacks a clearer path to a more viable answer. Errors are stepping stones to the next workable possibility. Fear of failure can immobilize the creative process.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>16.2  /H17074). This is the social well-being aspect of \nspiritual well-being. The desire to belong is considered a basic human need, as was \ufb01  rst suggested by Maslow in 1943. There are several theories as to why social support  \nis considered an aid in the coping process. The buffer theory, proposed by Cassel (1976), suggests that social support acts as a buffer against stress, in that social ties tend to \ufb01  lter out the deleterious effects of both ordinary hassles and devastating life events. This theory is shared by several researchers in the \ufb01  eld of health psychology, but the exact dynamics of this buffering action are still uncertain. Connell and D\u2019Augelli (1990) hypothesized that when individuals express fondness for others and make themselves available to both receive help (succor) as well as give help (nurturance), perceptions of stress are signi\ufb01  cantly decreased. In the compensation theory, \nsocial support is thought to act as a compensation for those who are at an emotional loss because of life\u2019s stress-\nSocial support: A coping technique; those groups of \nfriends, family members, and others whose company acts to buffer against and dissipate the negative effects of stress. Buffer theory: A theory that suggests that people \ninvited to a support group act to buffer the partici-pants from stress to lessen the impact. Compensation theory: A theory suggesting that \nsupport groups compensate for various emotional losses one experiences during stress. More and more, evidence points to the idea that strong social \nsupport from friends may act to buffer against the ill effects of stress and add to both the quality and quantity of life.

The first is comparing yourself to people who are worse of f\nthan you and realizing you don\u2019 t have it so bad. Doing this frequently will\nget you in the habit of tearing  others down in order to feel b etter aboutyourself. The second is seeking reassurance or compliments from others.

Other people feel good about\nthemselves on the whole, but s till feel anxious and out of their depth in\nspecific social situations. Situational confidence comes in two flavors. When you\u2019re situationally\nconfident, you\u2019re feeling one or both of two mental states. The first is a\ncalm, logical knowledge that y ou have the ability to handle yourself in\nthose circumstances. The second is a bold, psyched-up feeling. Feeling calmly confident about your capabilities\nWhen y ou\u2019re truly confident in your ability to succeed in a specific\nsituation, you know you can per form well the same way you know the sky\nis blue. Y ou have a well-tested skillset or some other reliable advantage. Y our certainty comes from a string of past successes. Th is kind of\nconfidence has to be earned. When you feel confident in this  way , you have a realistic sense of what\nyou\u2019re c apable o f and believe y our tools are good enough to complete the\njob.

One\u2019s style of prayer may be a function of one\u2019s personality type. Research by the Spindrift Organization in Salem, Oregon, suggests that introverts and extroverts tend to organize their prayer thoughts in different ways (Sweet, 2007). The prayer style of extroverts tends to be more goal oriented, while introverts are noted as being more general (e.g., Thy will be done, or go with the \ufb02  ow), \nwith both styles showing effectiveness. There are those who hesitate to include prayer as a viable \ncoping strategy because they believe that it nurtures false (negative) hope and perhaps even encourages an external locus of control, both of which are thought to negate the premise of positive coping techniques. However, it is held by those who do believe in prayer as a viable coping strat-egy that it can draw upon those inner resources that con-tribute to dealing with stress successfully. In the words of Jackson H. Brown, \u201cDo not pray for things, but rather pray for wisdom and courage.\u201d When prayer is used as a means to strengthen faith and provide hope, it can be an effective coping mechanism; in the words of John F.

The \ufb01  rst attempt to shoot a \nbasket through the hoop may result in an embar-rassing miss. Evaluate the new attitude and decide how bene\ufb01  cial it was. If it turns out that the new \nmind frame was a complete failure, return to stage 2 and create a new reappraisal. If the new mind frame worked, repeat this process with stressors that demand a change in attitude to resolve and bring closure. Some Additional Tips for \nCognitive Restructuring\n 1. Initiate a relaxation technique to calm your mind. When a relaxation technique is employed, the mind begins to unwind and consciousness shifts from an analytical mode to one of receptivity. In this unwinding process, unimportant thoughts begging the conscious mind for attention are dis-missed, allowing greater receptivity to a wider perspective on the issue at hand. A wider perspec-tive in turn fosters personal enlightenment and opens up room for positive thoughts. (See Chap-ter 18, \u201cMeditation.\u201d)\n 2. Take responsibility for your own thoughts. In times of stress we may feel victimized. We may also feel that things are out of our control. A way to gain temporary control is to blame others for the per-sonal injustice of the perceived stressor. Blame is associated with guilt and guilt can be a toxic thought. If you \ufb01  nd yourself blaming others for \nevents that make you feel victimized, ask yourself how you can turn this blame into personal respon-sibility for your own thoughts and feelings with-\nout\n feeling guilty. 3.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "4.

Among these new residents was \nDane Karen Blixen, new wife of Baron von Blixen, who settled down to carve out a life at the foot of the Ngong Hills, just outside Nairobi. A life of high adventure is not without its stressful episodes. In her 17 years on the African continent, Karen would contract syphilis from an unfaithful husband, sever her relationship with him, lose her farm to \ufb01  re, and lose her land to bankruptcy. Perhaps worst of all was losing the one man she loved, Denys Finch-Hatton, in the crash of his two-seater Gypsy Moth plane. Throughout her life in Africa, Karen wrote. Writing \nand storytelling became a release, almost an escape, but in every case, a means to cope with the changes she encountered. Upon what she called \u201can ungraceful return\u201d to her home in Denmark, Karen began to orga-nize and compose the memories of her African adven-tures. The result: a wonderful collection of personal experiences intertwining the sad with the sublime (writ-ten under the pen name Isak Dinesen) that became the classic memoir Out of Africa. Although not everyone is a novelist, we all have life adventures that merit, often necessitate, expression\u2014expression that helps to ease the pain of the soul. In the words of Karen Blixen, \u201cAll sorrows can be borne, if you put them in a story.\u201d\nTo open up and disclose feelings, perceptions, opinions, \nand memories have always been found to be therapeutic. Confessions of the mind lighten the burden of the soul. Many religions have adapted this concept for spiritual healing.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>What\tis\nyour\tgut\ttelling\tyou\tabout\tthem?

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Don\u2019 t let it happen again\u201d). D i s c o u r a g e m e n t  /  p e s s i m i s m\nFeeling discoura ged or pessimistic is an issue that is dif ferent fro m the three\nabove, b ut often  goes hand in hand with them. The methods for addressing\nit are the same  as well. A history of poor social outcomes can lead to\npessimism and discouragement about meeting your goals to improve your\nsocial situation. Feeling discouraged can then cause you to develop a\nnumber of counterproductive m ind-sets that can hinder you even further . It\ncan also  lead to self-sabotaging  behavior where you don\u2019 t try because you\n\u201cknow\u201d you\u2019ll fail anyway . Here are some typical discouraging thoughts:\n\u201cI\u2019m too unlikable. There\u2019 s no point in trying anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI could go to that party , but it won\u2019 t get me anywhere, so I\u2019ll take a\npass.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably reject me, so I won\u2019 t bother talking to them.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem bored by me. I\u2019ll bow out of the conversation now to\nsave us both time.\u201d\n\u201cHe just gave me his number and said we should grab a beer\nsometime. It never works out when I follow up with someone, so I\nwon\u2019 t bother .\u201d\n\u201cMaybe other awkward people can improve, but my set of issues is\ntoo much to overcome.\u201dThe fou r related problems of shyness, social anxiety , insecurity , and\ndiscouragement need to be tackled directly . Y ou should do som e work on\nthem be fore wor king on conversation or social life issues you want to fix. If\nyou\u2019re s hy and insecure around people, you can indirectly become more\nconfident by developing you r conversation and friend-ma king skills\n(assuming they\u2019 re not already fine and your shyness just blocks them from\ncoming out). One warning though: If you attempt to practice your social\nskills bu t haven\u2019 t taken steps to  address the counterproductive thinking at\nthe core of your  shyness and an xiety , you may end up worse of f. Y ou\u2019ll put\nyourself in social situations but still see them as dangerous and high-stakes;\nif so mething goes wrong, you may come to inaccurate, disheartening\nconclusions about yourself and your hopes of improving. Y ou d on\u2019 t have to\nget your thinking to a flawless place before you start working on your\npeople skills, but your though ts should be at a level where they won\u2019 t\ncompletely sabotage you either .4\nS h i f t i n g  y o u r  M i n d - S e t  a b o u t  Y o u r  S o c i a l\nD i s c o m f o r t\nB EFORE  YOU  CAN  ST AR T  WORKING  on  any shyness, anxiety , or  lack of\nconfidence, you  need to develo p the right mind-set for dealing  with these\nproblems. People often believe two big myths that give their social\ndiscomfort too much power and hinder their ability to deal with it:\n1 . \u201cThere must be a way to tot ally eradicate my shyness, social\nanxiety , and insecurities (and the refore I\u2019ll put improving my social\nlife on hold until I do that).\u201d\n2 . \u201cI c an\u2019 t show any signs of social discomfort to people. It\u2019 s\nshameful and will ruin the interaction.\u201d\nY ou\u2019ll h ave to do some work,  but you can limit the impact of these\ncounterproductive mind-sets. This chapter presents some useful attitudes to\nadopt re garding social situations . If you keep these points in min d, you\u2019ll be\non y our way to feeling more comfortable around people and h andling any\nuneasiness that pops up along the way . K n o w  a n d  a c c e p t  t h a t  y o u \u2019 l l  n e v e r  b a n i s h  a l l  s o c i a l\nd i s c o m f o r t  f r o m  y o u r  l i f e\nAlthough the strategies in the following chapters will help you  turn down\nthe dial on yo ur social discomfort, you\u2019ll never banish those issues\ncompletely . Humans just aren\u2019 t wired to be blissfully happy and self-assured 100 percent of the time. Even if you learn and apply every coping\nstrategy there is, you need to accept that the following things will still\nhappen:\nAt times you\u2019ll have worried, insecure, or counterproductive\nthoughts, even if you use every technique you know to try to make\nthem go away . Sometimes you\u2019ll feel anxious, regardless of how much you try to\ncontrol it or logically realize there\u2019 s nothing to fret about. Some situations will always make you a little nervous, even if you\u2019ve\nsuccessfully gone through them plenty of times (for example, most\npeople never get entirely comfortable with public speaking or trying\nto start a conversation with someone they\u2019re attracted to). There will be instances where you\u2019ll make a mistake, get rejected, or\nlook bad in a social situation, even if you do everything you can to\nprevent it. Y ou\u2019ll feel down on yourself at times, no matter how much you try to\npsych yourself up or remind yourself of your strengths. Even if you seem to have your shyness and insecurities under\ncontrol, you may go through a stressful period in your life that makes\nthem flare up again. Y ou\u2019ll never be able to predict the future or have full certainty an\nupcoming social event will go well. Y ou may have been born with a tendency to be more anxious and\ninsecure than average, and it\u2019 s something you\u2019ll have to learn to work\naround. Accepting that you may sometimes get uncomfortable in social situations\ntakes away some of the control your shyness and insecurities have over you. For example, if you think awkward silences are terrible, you\u2019ll avoidcountless conve rsations in an attempt to only chat to someone under the\nperfect, safe set of conditions. If you make peace with the fact that lulls\nhappen sometimes, no matter how prepared you are, you\u2019ll be willing to\ntalk to more people. Even wh en you  really don\u2019 t wa nt a certain outcome, you\u2019ll of ten feel a\nkind of relief when you know for sure it\u2019 s going to happen. At least the\nuncertainty and \u201cwhat if?\u201d wor rying are gone, and you can focus on how\nyou\u2019re going to handle it. If you knew with 100 percent certainty you were\ngoing to stumble over your w ords whenever you met someone new , it\nwould be inconvenient, but you could shift your ener gy toward  coming up\nwith strategies to deal with that fact. A i m  t o  b e c o m e  s o c i a l l y  f u n c t i o n a l ,  r a t h e r  t h a n  1 0 0\np e r c e n t  a s s u r e d  a t  a l l  t i m e s\nAfter yo u accept that you\u2019re st ill going to encounter some social unease\nfrom time to time, your aim should be to become socially functional , where\neven if you\u2019re nervous or self-doubting, you can still meet your goals. Don\u2019 t\nput your social life on hold un til you wipe all shyness from your mind,\nbecause that will never happen. A key part of being functional is to realize\nyou can be shy , nervous, or insecure during a social event and s till function\nand ultimately enjoy yourself. Socializing while experiencing a case of the jitters\nWhen p eople struggle with social anxiety , they sometimes look at their\ndiscomfort in either\u2013or terms when they\u2019re deciding whether to attend a\nget-together . They think if they\u2019re not completely confident and relaxed,\nthen they have to skip it. If ne rves strike when they\u2019re with people, they\nthink the whole outing is ruined.Y ou can get through most social  situations with some self-doubt or jitters. If your nerves or insecurities are mild, they may not interfere with your\noutward performance at all. Even if they trip you up a little, they won\u2019 t fully\nruin the interaction. Only the m ost extreme, sustained anxiety will do that. A co nversation can easily be a success, even if you trembled or  had trouble\nputting your thoughts together at the beginning of it. When looking back at an outing, how nervous or unsure you were at the\ntime becomes even less importa nt. If you get nervous in crowds but go to\nsee your  favorit e band anyway , five years from now you\u2019ll be happy you\nwent an d cherish the good memories you have; you\u2019ll hardly  regret the\nexperience because you felt on edge at the start of the show .

Knowing what ar e you working on when you practice your social skills\nAs you practice  socializing, you\u2019ll develop the following overall abilities. In s ome interactions, you\u2019ll d raw on only a few of them, while other\ninteractions will require you to juggle many at a time. 1) Y our ability to think on your feet. When it\u2019 s your turn to say\nsomething, you can\u2019 t take forever to come up with your response. Also,\naside from the relatively predic table first minute or two, inter actions can\nquickly go in countless directions. It\u2019 s unfeasible to try to plan out\neverything you\u2019 re going to say ahead of time or map out how  to handle\nevery scenario in advance. Th e best you can do is learn so me general\nguidelines and then sharpen your ability to improvise. 2) Y our ability to multitask. When you\u2019re interacting with so meone, you\nhave to continu ally attend to s everal things at once. The othe r person is\nconstantly sending signals through their words, actions, and nonverbal\ncommunication; you have to take it in, evaluate it, and decide on the fly\nhow to act on your conclusions (\u201cThey just said they\u2019re not familiar with\ncycling. I\u2019ll have to adjust how I tell my anecdote.\u201d). At the sam e time, you\nhave to manage the signals you\u2019re sending (\u201cI\u2019m curious about what time it\nis, b ut I won\u2019 t check my watch now because it may make me lo ok like I\u2019m\nnot inter ested in their story .\u201d). A s you get better at socializing, taking in all\nof that informa tion and deciding what to do with it starts to feel less\noverwhelming. 3) Y our pr oficiency in a variety of concr ete subskills like listening,\nasserting yourself, or phrasing  an invitation. Like with any s kill, at first\nyou\u2019ll be clumsy and exaggerate d when you listen actively , ass ert yourself,\nor ex tend an invitation, but in time you\u2019ll develop a defter touch and be ableto c alibrate your behavior to t he situation at hand. For example, when\nyou\u2019re f irst getting the hang of  listening skills, you may sometimes come\nacross as an over -the-top therapist. W ith more practice, you\u2019ll be able to\nshow you care and that you\u2019re paying attention in a more subtle way . 4) Y our comfort level with va rious subskills, like making eye contact\nor starting conversations. S ome subskills, like making eye contact or\ninitiating a conversation, will m ake you feel nervous or unnat ural at first,\nbut the more you do them, the more normal they\u2019ll feel. 5) Y our general knowledge of people, what makes them tick , and how\nthey tend to r eact to various things . Every person is dif ferent, but w ith\nenough social experience, you\u2019ll start to notice broad patterns you can act\non. F or example, you may notice that people who are into a certain hobby\nalso tend to share the same political beliefs and conversation style, and you\ncan adjust accordingly . 6) Y our knowledge of various  social situations and how to  navigate\nthem. Y ou can learn th is through firsthand experience or by observing other\npeople who are more socially experienced than you. It\u2019 s poss ible to find\nadvice on common scenarios, like how to approach people at a party or turn\ndown an unreasonable request,  but in your day-to-day life, you\u2019ll come\nacross o ther sce narios that are too rare and esoteric to end up in any book. When y ou come  across these no vel situations, you may not always handle\nthem pe rfectly , but with time you can build up an overall sense  about how\nto approach them. 7) Y our knowledge of the unwritten social guidelines of your\nparticular cultur e, subcultur e, or gr oup of friends, and how  to adjust\nthe general communication-skills rules to fit them. This is another reason\nit\u2019 s impo ssible t o explain how to deal with every situation ahead of time. What may be co nsidered an appealing conversation style in one  country or\namong o ne circl e of friends may  be seen as obnoxious elsewher e. The onlyway to learn the rules for your social context is to be in it and observe them\nfor yourself. 8) Constructive mind-sets toward socializing. A well-intentioned, but\nunhelpful, variet y of social advic e is to suggest you adopt useful, but easier -\nsaid-than-done, mind-sets like, \u201cDon\u2019 t care too much about people\u2019 s\nopinions of you\u201d or \u201cJust go out to have fun and don\u2019 t fret abo ut how well\nyou soci alize.\u201d It\u2019 s great if you  can think like this, but you do n\u2019 t instantly\nacquire those worldviews just b y reading they\u2019re good to have. Instead, as\nyou soc ialize more and more, you\u2019ll have many small experiences and\nsuccesses that show firsthand these are good ways to think,  and you\u2019ll\ngradually add them into your worldview . 9) Y our personal social style. There ar e some general guidelin es for what\nmakes fo r a better or worse inte raction, but there isn\u2019 t a single right way to\nsocialize. Everyone has his or her own personality and strengths and\nweaknesses.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

The ability to be creative resides within each and every one of us. Creativity is not a gift\u2014it is a human birthright. But like muscles that atrophy with disuse, creativity must be exercised to be effective. For those of you who have let your creative abilities slip into hiber-nation, here is a refresher course in the basics. Julia Cameron is convinced that creativity is truly a \nbirthright for each individual. In her book The Artist\u2019s Way, Cameron states that because of a series of factors found in American society, we have, in essence, not just dulled the edge of our creative abilities, we have buried them. But what is lost can certainly be recovered, if not discovered, by reacquainting ourselves with the creative juices that course through our human veins. Cameron insists that the creative process is a spiritual one, and that to engage in the creative process invites us to par-ticipate as co-creators with that aspect of the divine self. Connecting with what she calls \u201cspiritual electricity,\u201d Cameron invites people to step outside the left-brain way of thinking and unite both hemispheres of thought when calling upon the creative forces to solve problems or to enjoy life in its fullness. Quoting sources from Johannes Brahms and Louis Armstrong to Louis Pasteur and Carl Jung (who all give credit to a divine co-partnership in innovativeness), Cameron illustrates a tapestry of creative skills that is available to everyone.

In the short term, this may seem confrontational and threatening, but in the long term, it relieves the pressure of undue stress and promotes inner peace.A chapter on communication skills would be incomplete \nwithout some mention of the dialogue that takes place between sexual partners. In light of the facts that more than 1 million people in the United States are now infected with HIV or have AIDS, and that the incidence of date rape is so high, this aspect of human behavior can no longer be left to assumptions. Tannen was right that men and women have different styles of communication, and nowhere is this more evident than in sexual rela-tions. Because of American social mores, the issues sur-rounding sexual relations are still considered taboo in normal conversation. Ironically, it may be these very mores that have nurtured an environment of hostility and anxiety with regard to sexual issues. At a time when trust is paramount, sexual desire and arousal seem to short-circuit the self-disclosure so vital to one\u2019s health. There are many issues involving sexual intercourse that \nare stressors behind closed doors. These include contra-ception, birth control, the risk of pregnancy, infertility, sexually transmitted diseases, vaginismus, molestation, celibacy, guilt, rape, self-respect, abortion, impotency, premature ejaculation, intimacy, the ability to reach orgasm, homosexuality, and sexual satisfaction. As you can see, this (incomplete) list is quite long, and each topic weighs heavily as a stressor for those who experi-ence it. Problems of a sexual nature do not go away once a couple has initiated sexual relations, either. To the contrary, if communications are poor at the start of a relationship, they tend to get worse as the relation-ship continues. Sex counselors advise that before, dur-\ning, and after every act of sexual intimacy there should be a thorough conversation airing problematic sexual issues. As any AIDS patient or woman with an unwanted pregnancy can tell you, the short-term pleasures of sex are surely not worth the risks involved. And days, months, or years of agony may ensue when other sexual matters go unresolved.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "1.

Necessity, it is said, is the mother of invention, and the human \nmind has risen to the occasion to create some fantastic inventions. There is no better time for necessity to bear the fruits of creativity than during times of frustration when one needs to get from point A to point B. At one time, the United States took pride in its American \ningenuity. Young in age and pregnant with possibilities, early generations of Americans made more improve-ments to the proverbial mouse trap than there are stars in the sky. Before the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was a productive society, the vast major-ity of its citizens making more than 70 percent of their household items themselves. As the country became a consumer society, however, more and more items were bought rather than made at home. The availability of several new inventions, like the washer and dryer, pro-vided more leisure time. But with some of these inven-tions, lifestyles became very comfortable, and our collective creative skills became dull (Mander, 1978; Jackson, 2004). With the advent of television, it is said, the creative American mind began showing signs of atrophy. People now take a passive role in the creative process, letting other people do the important, creative thinking. Experts agree that a happy mind is a creative mind. The inability to deal with many problems is directly related to the inability to tap into and utilize creativity. It would be unfair to point the \ufb01  nger of blame solely at television. Many critics believe that the American educational system continues to play a role in the decline of creative skills as well, by sti\ufb02  ing the limits of imagination with conformity and critical-thinking skills. More over, American companies are now looking to hire Asians who are deemed more creative. The dominant style of thinking in the Western hemisphere is considered left-brained: linear, logical and rational, analytical, and judgmental. Left-brain modes of think-ing are those most rewarded in both school and work environments.

In this case, as with other coping and relaxation techniques, the word therapy does not re\ufb02  ect weakness or needing help. Rather, art ther-apy serves to augment understanding of the personal awareness and resolution process. Art therapy appears to trigger a progression of two responses. The \ufb01  rst is a cathartic effect, whereby you can release pent-up emo-tions and thoughts from your mind onto paper (or clay). The second is a greater sense of personal awareness based on an objective look at or interpretation of the artwork\u2014that is, the message it suggests or implies. This interpretation or awareness is often a communica-tion from the unconscious mind regarding less-than-obvious symbolic images. Although an interpretation can be helpful in the self-awareness process, without some prior knowledge or assistance, meaning could also be overlooked, mistaken, or misconstrued. Thus, there are several factors to consider to ensure the effectiveness of this technique, including artistic roadblocks, materi-\nals, illustrative themes, and interpretation.

In this case, as with other coping and relaxation techniques, the word therapy does not re\ufb02  ect weakness or needing help. Rather, art ther-apy serves to augment understanding of the personal awareness and resolution process. Art therapy appears to trigger a progression of two responses. The \ufb01  rst is a cathartic effect, whereby you can release pent-up emo-tions and thoughts from your mind onto paper (or clay). The second is a greater sense of personal awareness based on an objective look at or interpretation of the artwork\u2014that is, the message it suggests or implies. This interpretation or awareness is often a communica-tion from the unconscious mind regarding less-than-obvious symbolic images. Although an interpretation can be helpful in the self-awareness process, without some prior knowledge or assistance, meaning could also be overlooked, mistaken, or misconstrued. Thus, there are several factors to consider to ensure the effectiveness of this technique, including artistic roadblocks, materi-\nals, illustrative themes, and interpretation. Artistic Roadblocks\nThe most common reaction people have to art therapy is, \u201cI can\u2019t draw!\u201d The truth is, everyone can draw, in a way  Expressive Art Therapy\n251speci\ufb01  c to their own talents and abilities.

Decision making requires a good sense of judgment, coupled with a sense of compassion.

When we have big decisions to make, we tend to drag our feet and, in the information age, it is not hard to become overwhelmed with tidbits of facts and \ufb01 gures.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Avoid manipulation. In the course of asserting yourself, you may \ufb01  nd that others may consciously \nor unconsciously try to block your efforts to accomplish resolution. The following are some roadblocks of manipulation to be aware of, as well as some suggested strategies that may help to dismantle them:\na. Intimidation. Asserting yourself may intimi-\ndate others who are in the habit of using ma-\nnipulation and control to get their way. They in turn may raise their voices and display their tempers. When you recognize this behavior, you can defuse it by saying that you want to hold off further discussion of this issue until the other person calms down. For example, \u201cI can see that you are quite angry; let\u2019s talk about this after lunch.\u201d\nb. Content substitution. Sometimes people will \ndraw peripheral issues into a discussion to derail the issue at hand. If you become aware that the concern you brought up has become lost in tangential issues, quickly shift focus back to the original topic until your issue has been put to rest. c. Personal attacks (character assassination). You \nmay \ufb01  nd that in an attempt to resolve an issue, \nthe person you are talking to comes back at you with a character \ufb02\n aw. One way to get \nback on track is to agree, in part, about the character \ufb02  aw and ignore the rest. Davis calls this response clouding, the attempt to de\ufb02  ect \nan attack by concurring with some part of it. When employing this technique, rephrase the attack in your best interest, and get back to the issue at hand.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Although often effective, chemotherapy is not infallible. It can not only kill cancer cells, but also destroy healthy cells.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Unsent letters . Another topic common to journal \nwriters is called \u201cunsent letters.\u201d One type of res-olution people tend to avoid like the plague is rifts occurring in relationships of any kind. The hard-est rift to resolve occurs when a friend or loved one dies without your getting the chance to say goodbye. Kathleen Adams (1990) states that unsent letters provide the opportunity for \u201cthe three C\u2019s\u201d: catharsis, clarity, and completion. As a cathartic tool, the drafting of an unsent letter allows release of suppressed emotions including grief, anger, or guilt. For this journal technique to prove effective, it is a given that the letter does not go in the mail so that emotions can bubble up freely and surface without fear of self-censorship or reprisal. We all carry excess emotional baggage from unresolved relationships. The drafting of unsent letters allows us to lighten our emotional load. Clarity becomes evident when the writer realizes there is no chance for rebuttal from the addressee. Under this circumstance, you can be as direct as you wish and state exactly how you feel and why you feel this way. Although writing a \n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   23956147_CH10_229_243.indd   239 9/29/08   11:07:16 PM9/29/08   11:07:16 PMChapter 10\nletter to someone you need to communicate with \ndoes not resolve all issues, it does begin to bring \nthe unresolved issues to closure. A variation on this journal technique is to write down thoughts of anger and hostility and then crumple up the paper and throw it away. The crumpling adds to the emotional catharsis.

So, here is a question for you: What goals and aspirations do you have that are sabotaged by early childhood programming (e.g., trust issues, self-esteem issues, con\ufb01  dence, perceptions of leisure, money, or relationships)? How can you reprogram new (positive) thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions of yourself that can steer you in the direction and to the destination you wish to go? When you can answer these questions you have really discovered \u201cthe secret.\u201d\nToxic Thoughts\nNegative perceptions are often the result of low self- esteem. They also perpetuate it by suppressing or oblit-erating feelings of self-worth and self-acceptance. It has been suggested (Can\ufb01  eld, 1988; Ingerman, 2007) that toxic thoughts originate from repeated exposure to feel-ings of shame and guilt in early childhood. Can\ufb01  eld \ncites a study conducted at the University of Iowa where parent\u2013child interactions were observed over a period of several days. Results revealed that, on average, there were 400 negative comments for every positive one spo-ken to the child. It was concluded that negative thoughts are actually a conditioned (learned) response that is then carried into adulthood. Catastrophic thoughts are also reinforced in the messages we receive from the head-lines\u2014rarely does a human interest story beat a cata-clysmic event on the six o\u2019clock news. Disasters, world problems, and crimes permeate the news, which tends to condition our thinking toward the negative side of things. John-Roger even argues that negative thinking has an addictive quality to it. The term toxic thoughts was coined in the early 1980s \nby several psychologists to educate their clients about the dangers of negative thinking. Pessimism, a person-ality trait heavily grounded in negativism, promotes toxic thoughts. To demonstrate just how destructive they could be, Dr. Leslie Kaymen conducted a study at the University of Pennsylvania in 1989 to determine the phy siological responses to stress between individuals who identi\ufb01  ed themselves (through a psychological sur-vey) as either optimists or pessimists. All subjects were exposed to minute doses of pathogens (tetanus, mumps, and yeast), which, when placed on the skin, would indi-cate their stress-tolerance levels. Subjects were then \n204Chapter 8\nToxic thoughts: Repeated negative thought pro-\ncessing that tends to pollute our view of our lives and ourselves. 56147_CH08_195_215.indd   20456147_CH08_195_215.indd   204 10/1/08   11:03:58 AM10/1/08   11:03:58 AMCognitive Restructuring: Reframing\n205divided by attitude into two groups, and both groups \nwere given an impossible task to complete in a brief time period. While the pessimists quickly gave up, the optimists continued until the last possible moment. Days later, the PNI response (skin rashes) of the pessi-mists was signi\ufb01  cantly greater than that of the optimists. These results revealed that an optimistic attitude was associated with sound physical health, whereas a nega-tive attitude perpetuated the mental and physical stress response. In short, negative thoughts can have a toxic effect on the body. Kaymen\u2019s data analysis con\ufb01  rms the hypothesis that negative thinking can suppress the immune system. In an updated version of Kaymen\u2019s work, Andrew \nSteptoe and colleagues (2008) designed a study with nearly 3,000 subjects to examine the biological links of positive thoughts (mood). Results revealed that both men and women who reported experiencing a happy mood had lower cortisol levels, suggesting that happiness and optimism reduce biological vulnerability. Moreover, female subjects indicated signi\ufb01  cant decreased amounts \n205\nStress  with a Human Face\nA tribute to Allison Fisher: In \nthe spring of 1991, I had a remarkable student named \nAllison Fisher. Allison was bright, energetic, and beam-ing with success. At the midpoint of each semester, I invite my students to do an exercise called \u201cConfronta-tion of a Stressor.\u201d I believe that the concepts of stress management remain only concepts if they are not prac-ticed outside the classroom. In other words, to know and not to do is not to know. In this exercise students are asked to pick one of their top three stressors and are given two weeks to resolve it\u2014with the condition that they must enter the classroom with no bruises or broken bones. Although students are asked to write up this assignment, on the day it\u2019s due we all sit in a circle with the lights down low and, one by one, under an agree-ment of con\ufb01  dentiality, we share our stories. This par-ticular semester Allison went \ufb01  rst. \u201cMy stressor is breast cancer; it runs in the family,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy mother has had it\u2014my aunt and my grand mother, too. For many years I have been scared of \nbreast cancer, because I know I am at risk. Upon hearing this assignment, I decided it was time to go for a mam-mogram. I was extremely nervous, but last week I made an appointment with my physician.\u201d\nThe class was silent, all eyes \ufb01  xed on Allison. With an air \nof con\ufb01  dence, she concluded her story with a smile: \u201cI \nam happy to say that the test was negative!\u201dAs a graduating senior with a major in broadcast journal-\nism, Allison was looking forward to a promising broadcast-ing career. Less than a month after her graduation, she found herself working for a PBS af\ufb01  liate. Within a year\u2019s time, she took a job with Voice of America and then moved to Los Angeles to start a highly coveted job as an anchor/ reporter for Channel One, a cable program for high school youth. Several years later our paths would cross again, when I found myself in Los Angeles for a book signing.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Wrong.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Consider keeping a section of your journal for \ncreative ideas, doodling, and photo collages. Best Application of Journal Writing\nGood-quality journal writing has several purposes. The \ufb01 rst is to act as a personal sounding board\u2014to cleanse \nthe mind overloaded with perceptions, emotions, and toxic thoughts. Journal writing is a great way to vent anger. In moments of rage, a verbal description helps pinpoint how and why these feelings are surfacing. Sometimes writing how you feel, and perhaps what you should have said or would like to say, becomes a draft script to resolve issues between you and the person(s) involved in your perceived stress. Writing down feel-ings of anxiety and apprehension is a good release of emotions that can drain your energy. Effective coping involves the ability to access and employ both internal and external resources. The second purpose is to map out strategies for resolu-\ntion, both attitudinal perceptions and behavioral changes. Depending on the situation, these two pur-poses can be used as an offensive tactic in the face of stress, or in strategic planning when in momentary retreat. As an offensive tactic, journal writing can be used to cope with an immediate problem. Just by pull-ing out a pad of paper and pen and writing down what is on your mind, thoughts become organized and order begins to emerge from chaos. In many stressful events, however, this option is not possible. Then journal writ-ing can be used as a postponed coping response, perhaps at the end of the day, to collect your thoughts and pro-cess major events\u2014those chronic stressors\u2014that need attention. Last, a periodic review of journal entries serves to increase awareness of trends and patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Recognition of trends is the \ufb01  rst step in changing undesired or negative thoughts and actions in an effort to reach your highest human potential and enjoy inner peace. Although the primary resource needed for journal writing is a single notebook, you might consider having two: one very private one to be used exclusively at home, and a second one, perhaps less structured, to be used at work. Personal computers have added a whole new dimen-\nsion to journal writing that was inconceivable just two decades ago. Many people have found that using a word processor actually allows them to write as fast as they think, thereby enabling them to capture the essence of several thoughts simultaneously, rather than \ufb01  ghting to retrieve some. If you \ufb01  nd it easier to type entries in a personal computer \ufb01  le than in a note-book, give it a try. 240\n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   24056147_CH10_229_243.indd   240 9/29/08   11:07:17 PM9/29/08   11:07:17 PM241 Journal Writing\nI Journal writing has been used as a form of self-\nexpression and soul searching for centuries. Psycho-logists and health educators have advocated journal writing for decades as a means to increase self-awareness on issues that need attention. I Journal writing is said to promote emotional catharsis when thoughts, perceptions, attitudes, values, beliefs, and the tensions these create are allowed to work themselves out on paper. I Use of soul searching is no coincidence as a stress-management technique because this activity is the epitome of the emptying process. I There are short-term and long-term effects of habitual journal writing. Short-term bene\ufb01  ts \ninclude releasing pent-up feelings of anger and anxiety. When a series of journal entries is reread, long-term effects include seeing patterns and habits of thought, perceptions, and behaviors that are not detectable on an entry-to-entry basis. Putting thoughts down on paper also widens one\u2019s perspective to become more receptive to solutions and resolutions to stressors. I An additional bene\ufb01  t, demonstrated by \nPennebaker, is that writing about personal expe-riences in a journal increases the integrity of the immune system. Expressive writing has also proved to bene\ufb01  t \ufb01 bromyalsia patients, wives of \nU.S. servicemen, as well as decrease resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels. I Not all journal entries have to be written in prose form. Poetry therapy is likened to making order out of personal chaos. This coping style is used in many settings, including prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, and counseling centers. I There is no wrong way to write a journal, save writing too infrequently. This chapter gave a number of guidelines for effective journal writ-ing, including several themes (Buzan, dreams, and unsent letters) that can add variety to your repertoire of entry styles.SUMMARY\nSTUDY GUIDE QUESTIONS\n 1.

Monopolizing the conversation by hogging too much of thespotlight and not letting other s speak:  Although some people like\ntalking more than others, in g eneral everyone in the conversation\nshould have equal time to c ontribute. The exception is when\neveryone has clearly shown inte rest in letting you take center stage to\nshare a longer story or opinion.

It is believed by some scholars that all verbal expression is rooted in persuasion. When persuasion is used to win a con\ufb02  ict at the expense of others, it is viewed as negative. But persuasion can be a positive style as well. In the initial stage of the con\ufb02  ict-resolution \nprocess, all voices need to be heard. Persuasion may include the use of reason, emotional awareness, or motivation to get a point across. When used tact-fully, persuasion opens new lines of thinking, which can then be tools to resolve issues and pro-mote mutual agreement. 5. Dialogue. Dialogue is a verbal exchange of opin-ions, attitudes, facts, and perceptions that opens the doors to greater understanding of the nature of the problem. During the dialogue process, dis-cussions center on the costs and bene\ufb01  ts of solving \na problem. Dialogue involves the same steps as those employed for creative problem solving (see Chapter 13). In dialogue, negotiations are a means to a solution to which all parties feel they have made a contribution. Compromise plays an important role in the dialogue process because the intent is to reach a decision that is agreeable to everyone.Steps to Enhance \nCommunication Skills\nThe following are additional suggestions to strengthen \nyour communication skills and help promote con\ufb02  ict \nresolution.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>For a host of reasons, people natu-\nrally tend to have an inability to fully express the entire  \nrange of human emotions. This conscious inhibition of\n \nemotional expression, coupled with the unconscious sup-pression of perceptions, attitudes, and feelings, may even-tually result in neurotic (worrisome) behavior or the manifestation of physical symptoms. The results can be devastating, perhaps leading one to several visits to a psy-chologist. One of the primary goals of psychotherapy is to nurture self-awareness and honest self-expression. In the short term, self-expression through journal writ-\ning may serve as an emotional catharsis by getting out on paper the toxic thoughts roaming through one\u2019s head. Journal writing allows the release of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions that liberates the mind and softens or expands the walls of the ego. Journal writing has often been called a writing meditation because as old thoughts are permitted to leave, the empty space they once occupied allows for expanded awareness of one\u2019s internal landscape as well as expanded depth of thought. This expanded awareness is analogous to a panoramic view from a mountaintop compared to an obstructed view from the base. Increased awareness opens the door for increased understanding of ourselves in our many environments. Writing down personal thoughts gives one permission to let them go, no longer thinking about them with the intensity that may have cluttered the mind and drained energy. Release of thoughts and feelings may also act as a personal confes-sion, an honest confrontation of one\u2019s behaviors. And this is an initial step toward healing both one\u2019s internal relationship and personal relationships with others. In addition, unlike conversation or internal dialogue, use of writing as a channel of self-expression makes the writer accountable for, or allows the writer to take solid ownership of, feelings as abstract thoughts become tan-gible on paper. (See Box 10.1.)\nPoetry therapy: A therapeutic tool; a modality of \nwriting poetry to enhance both increased awareness and emotional catharsis of a variety of issues. The art of journal writing goes back eons.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The dialogue mentioned earlier that seems to run non-stop in our minds is referred to as self-talk, and it has \nbeen observed that the preponderance of this is negative self-thoughts. Schafer (1999) has identi\ufb01  ed several types of negative self-talk thinking patterns that produce and/or perpetuate the toxic-thought process. He lists them in the following categories: pessimism, or looking at the worst of almost every situation; catastrophizing, mak-\ning the worst of a situation; blaming, shifting the responsibility for circumstances to someone other than yourself; perfectionism, imposing above-human stan-\ndards on yourself; polarized thinking , where everything \nis seen as an extreme (good versus bad) and there is no middle ground; should-ing, reprimanding yourself for \nthings you should have done; and magnifying, blowing \nproblems out of proportion. One technique to convert negative thoughts to neutral \nthoughts, similar to Ellis\u2019s REBT, is called thought stop-ping. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, you interrupt the \ufb02  ow of conscious ness and say to yourself, \u201cStop this thought.\u201d With practice, thought stopping can help to disarm your negative critic and give balance to your emotional thoughts. As you can see, toxic thoughts are very real.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Naturally , the negative side is\nthat some people won\u2019 t understand, think even worse of you, or get the\nwrong idea about what the cond ition means. Therefore, you\u2019ll need to think\nabout whether you should tell someone like your boss as opposed to a\nstranger at a party you\u2019ll never see again.T\n\t1\t\nTHE\tJOURNEY\nhe\twarm\tCalifornia\tsun\tgreeted\tButch\tConnor\tas\the\tstepped\tout\tof\this\ttruck\nand\tonto\tthe\tsands\tof\tSalmon\tCreek\tBeach.

This is the social well-being aspect of \nspiritual well-being. The desire to belong is considered a basic human need, as was \ufb01  rst suggested by Maslow in 1943. There are several theories as to why social support  \nis considered an aid in the coping process. The buffer theory, proposed by Cassel (1976), suggests that social support acts as a buffer against stress, in that social ties tend to \ufb01  lter out the deleterious effects of both ordinary hassles and devastating life events. This theory is shared by several researchers in the \ufb01  eld of health psychology, but the exact dynamics of this buffering action are still uncertain. Connell and D\u2019Augelli (1990) hypothesized that when individuals express fondness for others and make themselves available to both receive help (succor) as well as give help (nurturance), perceptions of stress are signi\ufb01  cantly decreased. In the compensation theory, \nsocial support is thought to act as a compensation for those who are at an emotional loss because of life\u2019s stress-\nSocial support: A coping technique; those groups of \nfriends, family members, and others whose company acts to buffer against and dissipate the negative effects of stress. Buffer theory: A theory that suggests that people \ninvited to a support group act to buffer the partici-pants from stress to lessen the impact. Compensation theory: A theory suggesting that \nsupport groups compensate for various emotional losses one experiences during stress. More and more, evidence points to the idea that strong social \nsupport from friends may act to buffer against the ill effects of stress and add to both the quality and quantity of life.

The following are two de\ufb01  nitions to illustrate this elusive perception (McGhee, 1979):\n 1.

First, if you feel you\u2019re\nsocially inexperienced all around, you can simply find ways to spend more\ntime soc ializing. This method is unstructured, but you\u2019ll still learn new\nthings from all the extra hours you\u2019ll rack up, and hone a varie ty of skills. Y ou can\nsocialize more with the people you already know (existing friends,\ncoworkers, classmates, roommates, family members);\nget a job that involves lots of interaction with people (for example,retail, restaurant server , bartender , call center , sales);\nsign up for a volunteer position that involves socializing (for\nexample, fundraising, talking to seniors, helping out at a festival);\njoin a club, team, or or ganization;\nattend online-or ganized meet-ups (for example, from a forum you\nuse, through sites like Meetup.com);\ntake advantage of natural opportunities to have brief, friendly\ninteractions with people who are generally expected to be pleasant\nand chat with you, such as store clerks and restaurant servers;\ngo to a venue where people can show up alone and be social with the\nother patrons (for example, a board game caf\u00e9, a pub or pool hall);\ninteract with people online (for example, chatting with people while\nplaying a multiplayer game). Of course, this can\u2019 t be a complete\nsubstitute for face-to-face practice, but it shouldn\u2019 t be dismissed\nentirely either; or\nif it\u2019 s a realistic option, travel and stay in busy , social hostels. A second method is to practice in a deliberate, structured way , especially\nif you want to work on specific skills. For example, if you h ave trouble\nstarting conversations, you could attend one online-or ganized meet-up a\nweek an d talk to at least five n ew people each time. If you have trouble\nwith a specific type of interaction, like inviting someone out or turning\ndown an unreasonable request, you could practice by role-playing the\nscenario with a friend or fa mily member . Some or ganizations and\ncounseling agencies run social skills training groups that provide\nopportunities to practice in a safe, supportive environment. A third way to practice socially  is to take a class to learn a performance-\noriented interper sonal skill like public speaking, acting, or improv or stand-\nup comedy . These more speciali zed skills don\u2019 t fully carry over into day-to-\nday situ ations.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>When\tyou\tcan\u2019t\tkeep\tyour\tbody\tlanguage\tin\ncheck,\tit\tis\ta\tclear\tsign\tthat\tyour\temotions\tare\tgetting\tthe\tbest\tof\tyou.

Many people go in cycles, where they write religiously for months at a time, get a block, and then abandon their journals for a stretch. Sometime later, they come back to this coping style after a hiatus of a few weeks to a month. Writer\u2019s block can be overcome by trying a new approach or theme to journal entries, includ-ing creative writing or entries in the form of letters. For example, the book The Color Purple  was written as a \nseries of letters by author Alice Walker to a \ufb01  ctitious sis-\nter in Africa. If you \ufb01  nd yourself with writer\u2019s block, try a new format of writing. In his book Opening Up: The Healing Power of Con\ufb01  ding \nin Others, author Jamie Pennebaker advocates journal \nwriting as a means of self-expression. Just as there can be bene\ufb01  ts to journal writing, however, it can also be used incorrectly, negating the potential personal gains to be made. The following are suggestions to keep in mind when using journal writing as a positive coping technique:\n 1. Journal writing should not be used to replace a more  \nviable coping technique\n. Journals can be great sound-\ning boards. The echoes from these passages should be a strong personal invitation to \ufb01  nd solutions to the problem at hand. Remember, for a coping tech-nique to be effective, it must work toward a peace-ful resolution. When journal writing is employed in place of more appropriate coping techniques, such as effective communication with other people (Chapter 14) or social engineering of factors for the betterment of your environment (Chapter 16), reso-lution is compromised, if not completely prevented, and full closure on stressors never comes. 2. Journal writing should encourage, not discourage, honest feelings. As a coping technique, journal writing invites the writer to soul-search and turn thoughts inward. Although many writing themes, concepts, and philosophies can be used as vehicles to explore and augment the soul-searching pro-cess, these should not be the speci\ufb01  c focus of one\u2019s \nwriting. The primary theme is the writer. Ideally, journals should be kept con\ufb01\n dential, though often \npeople choose to share parts of journal entries, sometimes entire passages. However, if journal entries are written for an audience other than yourself, then the likelihood of honesty is greatly compromised.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "Why is speaking to someone not emotionally invested in your problem recommended when facing issues?", "gold_answer": "Speaking to someone not emotionally invested in your problem is recommended when facing issues because it provides external perspective, helps maintain emotional detachment, and allows for objective analysis of information.", "answer": "Speaking to someone not emotionally invested in your problem is recommended when facing issues because it helps maintain a balance between emotions and actions, ensures objectivity in decision-making, and avoids impulsive decisions."}

Little children aren\u2019t parrots, but if you were \nto listen to how closely a child imitates his mom or dad,  \nyou would be amazed at the degree of accuracy in both\n \nlanguage and body postures. Modeling is a name given to \nthe concept of imitation\u2014that is, a behavior learned \nthrough imitation. Modeling differs from operant condi-tioning in that usually no direct reinforcement is involved. Out of sheer will, a person is motivated to copy one or several aspects of someone with whom they are closely bonded or to whom they \ufb01  nd some degree of attraction \n(Pescuric and Byham, 1996). It may be parents, but in the age of multi media exposure, it could be any public \ufb01  gure \nwith whom the individual wishes to identify. As might be expected, negative as well as positive behavior can be imitated, and often is. More often than not, the expres-sion \u201cLife imitates art\u201d comes to mind when individuals are seen to model negative behavior seen on television or in the movies. Although children often model themselves after those people they see as heroes, we never outgrow the capacity to model our behavior after someone we admire. During the aging process, the word hero changes \nto role model, or mentor. Modeling is typically used as a \ncrucial component in the practice of building self-esteem (see Chapter 6).</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>.

In time,\nyou\u2019ll d evelop a better understanding of your personal anxious tendencies\nand the course your anxiety tak es when it comes on. Y ou\u2019ll learn to step\nback, kn ow what\u2019 s coming, and apply a coping strategy . The following\nsections of fer advice for dealing with anxiety when you\u2019re on  your own,\nbefore a n upcom ing social event, during an event, and when you\u2019re in the\nmiddle of a social interaction. Dealing with anxiety when you\u2019r e on your own\nY ou can  use these approaches if nerves strike when you\u2019re, say , sitting at\nhome an d start thinking about an upcoming party you have to attend. Y ou\nshouldn\u2019 t use these strategies in the absence of shifting your overall attitude\ntoward your anxiety , but as a spot treatment they\u2019re fine. When you start to feel anxious, ride out the symptoms\nIf you can be with your anxiety and not overreact to it, it will often pass on\nits own (for m ore on this, see the previous chapter \u2019 s section onmindfulness). A llowing your anxiety to play out may be uncom fortable, but\nit will fade. Intense bouts of anx iety often feel longer than they are, but they\nusually last only about five to f ifteen minutes. Moderate nervo us episodes\nof th e pace-around-your -house- while-worrying variety can lin ger longer ,\nmaybe f or an hour or two. That \u2019 s more inconvenient, but ultimately only a\nsmall bit of the day . Question the thoughts that ar e contributing to your anxiety\nSometimes you\u2019ll be too worked up to logically disarm your nerves, but at\nother mo ments, you\u2019ll be able to  calm yourself if you question the thinking\nthat\u2019 s feeding your anxiety (see  the beginning of Chapter 5 for pointers). For exam ple, if an episode of ne rves is getting more intense bec ause you\u2019re\nthinking, \u201cIf I k eep getting anxious like this, I\u2019m going to go crazy ,\u201d you\ncould c alm down by reminding yourself that real mental illness or\n\u201ccraziness\u201d doesn\u2019 t develop that way . Distract yourself\nY ou may feel t oo nervous to believe you can focus on som ething else\nenough to distract yourself, bu t if you force it, your attention will often\nmove aw ay from your anxiety , a t least a little. Y ou could put on some music\nor a  movie, play a game, practice a skill, begin a text convers ation with a\nfamily m ember , go for a walk, or throw yourself into a mentally demanding\nproject. The breathing and relaxation techniques described in the next\nparagraph also have an element of distraction to them. Calm yourself with deep br eathing\nDeep breathing puts your body into \u201crelaxation mode,\u201d which will help\ncounteract your anxiety because you can\u2019 t physiologically be relaxed and\nkeyed u p at the same time. Bre athing works best if you catch the anxietyearly . The essence of deep breathing is to breathe slowly and from your\nabdomen. One technique is called 4-7-8 B reathing. Breathe in through your nose for\nfour sec onds. Hold the breath for seven seconds. Exhale through your\nmouth f or eight seconds. The e xact numbers aren\u2019 t super important. The\nkey is that you\u2019re thinking about your breathing while taking  time to do\neach step, instead of breathing r apidly , and that you\u2019re holding your breath\nand exhaling for twice as long as you\u2019re inhaling. This technique overrides\nyour tendency to take quick, shallow breaths when you\u2019re nervous, which\ncan make your physical sympto ms worse by changing the rati o of carbon\ndioxide in the body . Most people will find this exerc ise harmless and relaxing. However , you\nmay wan t to be careful if your a nxiety tends to get triggered wh enever you\nfocus too much on your breathing. Calm yourself with pr ogr essive muscle r elaxation\nThis works through the same pr inciple as deep breathing. A lo ose, relaxed\nbody is incompatible with a tense, nervous one. Set some time aside, make\nyourself comfortable, and lie down. T ake deep, slow breaths. W ork your\nway through each of your muscles, contracting them for about five seconds\nand then releasing them as you exhale. Y ou can make the exercise more\nef fective with some creative imagery . Y ou could picture your stress and\ntension as a gas being squeezed out of your muscles, or imagine your body\nis melting into the bed or couch. Put on soothing music or a r ecor ded guided r elaxation meditation\nIn a guided relaxation meditatio n, someone\u2019 s voice guides you into a state\nof ca lm through instructions and  soothing images (\u201cY ou\u2019re floating down a\nwarm, peaceful river on a sunny day .

In his much-acclaimed book, Learned \nOptimism, Seligman states that we are most likely to learn the traits of optimism or pessimism from our parents, but even if the environment in which we were raised was a negative one, we can cultivate the aspect of optimistic thinking and gravitate toward a positive approach to life. Seligman studied several nationally ranked swimmers prior to the 1988 Olympics and soon realized that opti-mism is not only an inherent trait, but one that can be augmented or learned. Using a term he coined, \ufb02  exible \noptimism, Seligman (Chapter 4) states that although the Cognitive Restructuring: Reframing\n207The human mind can be our greatest asset or our worst \nliability.

The methods for addressing\nit are the same  as well. A history of poor social outcomes can lead to\npessimism and discouragement about meeting your goals to improve your\nsocial situation. Feeling discouraged can then cause you to develop a\nnumber of counterproductive m ind-sets that can hinder you even further . It\ncan also  lead to self-sabotaging  behavior where you don\u2019 t try because you\n\u201cknow\u201d you\u2019ll fail anyway . Here are some typical discouraging thoughts:\n\u201cI\u2019m too unlikable. There\u2019 s no point in trying anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI could go to that party , but it won\u2019 t get me anywhere, so I\u2019ll take a\npass.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably reject me, so I won\u2019 t bother talking to them.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem bored by me.

Y ou should do som e work on\nthem be fore wor king on conversation or social life issues you want to fix. If\nyou\u2019re s hy and insecure around people, you can indirectly become more\nconfident by developing you r conversation and friend-ma king skills\n(assuming they\u2019 re not already fine and your shyness just blocks them from\ncoming out). One warning though: If you attempt to practice your social\nskills bu t haven\u2019 t taken steps to  address the counterproductive thinking at\nthe core of your  shyness and an xiety , you may end up worse of f. Y ou\u2019ll put\nyourself in social situations but still see them as dangerous and high-stakes;\nif so mething goes wrong, you may come to inaccurate, disheartening\nconclusions about yourself and your hopes of improving. Y ou d on\u2019 t have to\nget your thinking to a flawless place before you start working on your\npeople skills, but your though ts should be at a level where they won\u2019 t\ncompletely sabotage you either .4\nS h i f t i n g  y o u r  M i n d - S e t  a b o u t  Y o u r  S o c i a l\nD i s c o m f o r t\nB EFORE  YOU  CAN  ST AR T  WORKING  on  any shyness, anxiety , or  lack of\nconfidence, you  need to develo p the right mind-set for dealing  with these\nproblems. People often believe two big myths that give their social\ndiscomfort too much power and hinder their ability to deal with it:\n1 . \u201cThere must be a way to tot ally eradicate my shyness, social\nanxiety , and insecurities (and the refore I\u2019ll put improving my social\nlife on hold until I do that).\u201d\n2 . \u201cI c an\u2019 t show any signs of social discomfort to people. It\u2019 s\nshameful and will ruin the interaction.\u201d\nY ou\u2019ll h ave to do some work,  but you can limit the impact of these\ncounterproductive mind-sets. This chapter presents some useful attitudes to\nadopt re garding social situations . If you keep these points in min d, you\u2019ll be\non y our way to feeling more comfortable around people and h andling any\nuneasiness that pops up along the way . K n o w  a n d  a c c e p t  t h a t  y o u \u2019 l l  n e v e r  b a n i s h  a l l  s o c i a l\nd i s c o m f o r t  f r o m  y o u r  l i f e\nAlthough the strategies in the following chapters will help you  turn down\nthe dial on yo ur social discomfort, you\u2019ll never banish those issues\ncompletely . Humans just aren\u2019 t wired to be blissfully happy and self-assured 100 percent of the time. Even if you learn and apply every coping\nstrategy there is, you need to accept that the following things will still\nhappen:\nAt times you\u2019ll have worried, insecure, or counterproductive\nthoughts, even if you use every technique you know to try to make\nthem go away . Sometimes you\u2019ll feel anxious, regardless of how much you try to\ncontrol it or logically realize there\u2019 s nothing to fret about. Some situations will always make you a little nervous, even if you\u2019ve\nsuccessfully gone through them plenty of times (for example, most\npeople never get entirely comfortable with public speaking or trying\nto start a conversation with someone they\u2019re attracted to). There will be instances where you\u2019ll make a mistake, get rejected, or\nlook bad in a social situation, even if you do everything you can to\nprevent it. Y ou\u2019ll feel down on yourself at times, no matter how much you try to\npsych yourself up or remind yourself of your strengths. Even if you seem to have your shyness and insecurities under\ncontrol, you may go through a stressful period in your life that makes\nthem flare up again. Y ou\u2019ll never be able to predict the future or have full certainty an\nupcoming social event will go well. Y ou may have been born with a tendency to be more anxious and\ninsecure than average, and it\u2019 s something you\u2019ll have to learn to work\naround. Accepting that you may sometimes get uncomfortable in social situations\ntakes away some of the control your shyness and insecurities have over you. For example, if you think awkward silences are terrible, you\u2019ll avoidcountless conve rsations in an attempt to only chat to someone under the\nperfect, safe set of conditions. If you make peace with the fact that lulls\nhappen sometimes, no matter how prepared you are, you\u2019ll be willing to\ntalk to more people. Even wh en you  really don\u2019 t wa nt a certain outcome, you\u2019ll of ten feel a\nkind of relief when you know for sure it\u2019 s going to happen. At least the\nuncertainty and \u201cwhat if?\u201d wor rying are gone, and you can focus on how\nyou\u2019re going to handle it. If you knew with 100 percent certainty you were\ngoing to stumble over your w ords whenever you met someone new , it\nwould be inconvenient, but you could shift your ener gy toward  coming up\nwith strategies to deal with that fact. A i m  t o  b e c o m e  s o c i a l l y  f u n c t i o n a l ,  r a t h e r  t h a n  1 0 0\np e r c e n t  a s s u r e d  a t  a l l  t i m e s\nAfter yo u accept that you\u2019re st ill going to encounter some social unease\nfrom time to time, your aim should be to become socially functional , where\neven if you\u2019re nervous or self-doubting, you can still meet your goals. Don\u2019 t\nput your social life on hold un til you wipe all shyness from your mind,\nbecause that will never happen. A key part of being functional is to realize\nyou can be shy , nervous, or insecure during a social event and s till function\nand ultimately enjoy yourself. Socializing while experiencing a case of the jitters\nWhen p eople struggle with social anxiety , they sometimes look at their\ndiscomfort in either\u2013or terms when they\u2019re deciding whether to attend a\nget-together . They think if they\u2019re not completely confident and relaxed,\nthen they have to skip it. If ne rves strike when they\u2019re with people, they\nthink the whole outing is ruined.Y ou can get through most social  situations with some self-doubt or jitters. If your nerves or insecurities are mild, they may not interfere with your\noutward performance at all. Even if they trip you up a little, they won\u2019 t fully\nruin the interaction. Only the m ost extreme, sustained anxiety will do that. A co nversation can easily be a success, even if you trembled or  had trouble\nputting your thoughts together at the beginning of it. When looking back at an outing, how nervous or unsure you were at the\ntime becomes even less importa nt. If you get nervous in crowds but go to\nsee your  favorit e band anyway , five years from now you\u2019ll be happy you\nwent an d cherish the good memories you have; you\u2019ll hardly  regret the\nexperience because you felt on edge at the start of the show . Acknowledging that nervousness comes with valued goals\nFigure o ut what  is truly important to you in life and commit to going after\nit, re gardless of your fears or in securities.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

This is the social well-being aspect of \nspiritual well-being. The desire to belong is considered a basic human need, as was \ufb01  rst suggested by Maslow in 1943. There are several theories as to why social support  \nis considered an aid in the coping process. The buffer theory, proposed by Cassel (1976), suggests that social support acts as a buffer against stress, in that social ties tend to \ufb01  lter out the deleterious effects of both ordinary hassles and devastating life events. This theory is shared by several researchers in the \ufb01  eld of health psychology, but the exact dynamics of this buffering action are still uncertain. Connell and D\u2019Augelli (1990) hypothesized that when individuals express fondness for others and make themselves available to both receive help (succor) as well as give help (nurturance), perceptions of stress are signi\ufb01  cantly decreased. In the compensation theory, \nsocial support is thought to act as a compensation for those who are at an emotional loss because of life\u2019s stress-\nSocial support: A coping technique; those groups of \nfriends, family members, and others whose company acts to buffer against and dissipate the negative effects of stress. Buffer theory: A theory that suggests that people \ninvited to a support group act to buffer the partici-pants from stress to lessen the impact. Compensation theory: A theory suggesting that \nsupport groups compensate for various emotional losses one experiences during stress. More and more, evidence points to the idea that strong social \nsupport from friends may act to buffer against the ill effects of stress and add to both the quality and quantity of life.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Aggressive behavior style. The aggressive style is where one acts to intimidate others and gain con-trol of their thoughts and actions. Aggressive behavior includes manipulation, intimidation, accusations, and perhaps \ufb01  ghting. There is little \nor no regard for other people\u2019s feelings. Aggressive behavior may result in personal gain, but also breeds loss of respect and trust in those who were walked over and bruised on the way. The aggres-sive style is thought to be anger driven. It is often used by people who exhibit Type A behaviors. 3. Assertive behavior style\n. This is the preferable \nstyle, in which a person focuses on speci\ufb01  c issues \nand problems, neither belittling him- or herself nor attacking others in the process of problem solving (McKay and Fanning, 2000). An assertive person recognizes his or her individual rights and \n222to deal peacefully with confrontations. The term was reintroduced by Arnold Lazarus, who de\ufb01  ned it as \u201cexpressing personal rights and feelings.\u201d Since its introduction, it has become the major focus in changing stress-related behaviors. Passive behavior style: A behavior in\ufb02  uenced \nby intimidation that can often lead to feelings of \nresentment and victimization. Aggressive behavior style: An aggression-based \nbehavior that employs intimidation and manipulation. Assertive behavior style:  A behavior style that is \nneither passive nor aggressive, but one that is toler-\nant and considerate in the quest for individual rights.Chapter 9\nChanging behaviors is not always easy if they have been lifelong \nhabits. Some behaviorists suggest that change will take place only when there is suf\ufb01  cient desire.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Not all of his patients had this exceptional ability, and their draw ings often foreshadowed immi-nent death. In the spirit of Jung, Siegel soon came upon the realization that messages from the unconscious mind manifest in symbolic images and characteristics. These images accentuate the patient\u2019s fears, anger, lev-els of self-esteem, grief, guilt, and the intensity of the personal problems and con\ufb02  icts that ultimately pave the path to disease. In one illustration, a patient drew her-self at the extreme right-hand, bottom corner of the page, leaving the rest of the paper blank. This was inter-preted to suggest low self-esteem, which was later con-\ufb01 rmed by the artist. In a similar episode, a young boy \ndrew only the top half of his body over the entire page, leaving the physician curious and frightened. The young boy then turned the page over to reveal the bot-tom half, hinting that recovery was well on its way\u2014and putting a huge smile on Siegel\u2019s face. Although there are exceptions, there is a consensus \namong art therapists that regardless of gender, nation-ality, or ethnic upbringing, each color in art therapy represents an archetypal meaning. Typically, the color selection as well as the objects drawn (e.g., house, tree) parallel emotional expressions of one\u2019s mental health. The following list suggests associations between colors and their archetypal meanings:\nRed: passionate emotional peaks (from pleasure to \npain); can represent either compassion or anger\nOrange: life change (big or small)Yellow: energy (usually a positive message)Blue and green: happiness and joy (blue may even \nmean creativity)\nPurple/violet: highly spiritual nature; unconditional \nlove\nBrown (and earth-tone colors): a sense of grounded-\nness and stability\nBlack: (1) grief, despair, or fear or (2) a sense of per-\nsonal empowerment\nWhite: (1) fear, avoidance, or coverup or (2) hopeGray: ambiguity or uncertainty\nNot all professionals agree on the association between \ncolor selection and its interpretation; art therapist Rebecca Crane offers a slightly different explanation. In her professional experience, yellow and orange signify  Expressive Art Therapy\n249pleasantness or happiness. Violet and red convey unhap-piness. Speci\ufb01  cally, violet represents grief or death, while red is used to express anger, frustration, and annoyance. Although cancer patients have received the most public-\nity from their use of art therapy as a coping technique, art therapists have also used this tool in the awareness and recovery process of other stress-related problems, including migraine headaches (\nFIG. 11.5  /H17073), gastro-\nintestinal problems, anorexia, and post-traumatic stress disorders of patients surviving the atrocities of war. The creation of sketches and sculptures has been a signi\ufb01  cant \ntool in the treatment of Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as described by J. Horgan (1988) in Scienti\ufb01  c American.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The recognition of this importance reveals vari-ous aspects of one\u2019s psychic landscape. And, as much can be revealed by what is not drawn as by what is pic-torially represented. For instance, in self-portraits, peo-ple who draw faces with no mouths or ears suggest an inability to express their feelings verbally. Long arms may express a desire to reach out for help or affection. Short arms may signify feelings of withdrawal. Short necks indicate stubbornness. Boxed shoulders hint of the inability to let matters roll off the back. According to art therapist Evelyn Virshup (1978), the \nimportance of art therapy is in the process, not necessarily the outcome. The expression of oneself through art far exceeds the aesthetic quality to the viewer: \u201cSomeone who is asked to draw how they feel, and is then measured by the yardstick of aesthetics will feel betrayed, and will repress further feelings. Creativity of expression is sti\ufb02  ed \nby judgmental evaluation.\u201d A crucial factor in the prac-tice of art therapy is the collaborative verbal description of the picture once it has been drawn. The role of the art therapist is to guide the artist through his or her under-standing of each work. This is done by asking open-ended questions such as, What does the picture mean? In many cases, the artist may not overtly recognize the emo-tional signi\ufb01  cance of the work (e.g., missing features, sig-ni\ufb01 cant color selection, or disproportional \ufb01  gures) or may \nnot be quite ready to accept verbally what has been depicted graphically. Art therapists suggest that, upon completion of the drawing, the artist try to explain what the \ufb01  gure represents, perhaps even to write it down on the corner of the drawing. This serves to balance the non-verbal expression with the verbal expression and further the communication process of the conscious and uncon-scious minds.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2. How can long arms in a drawing express a certain desire?", "gold_answer": ": Long arms in a drawing can express a desire to reach out for help or affection, as indicated by the context provided.", "answer": ": Long arms in a drawing can express a desire for connection, intimacy, or support."}
{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>The dialogue mentioned earlier that seems to run non-stop in our minds is referred to as self-talk, and it has \nbeen observed that the preponderance of this is negative self-thoughts. Schafer (1999) has identi\ufb01  ed several types of negative self-talk thinking patterns that produce and/or perpetuate the toxic-thought process. He lists them in the following categories: pessimism, or looking at the worst of almost every situation; catastrophizing, mak-\ning the worst of a situation; blaming, shifting the responsibility for circumstances to someone other than yourself; perfectionism, imposing above-human stan-\ndards on yourself; polarized thinking , where everything \nis seen as an extreme (good versus bad) and there is no middle ground; should-ing, reprimanding yourself for \nthings you should have done; and magnifying, blowing \nproblems out of proportion. One technique to convert negative thoughts to neutral \nthoughts, similar to Ellis\u2019s REBT, is called thought stop-ping. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, you interrupt the \ufb02  ow of conscious ness and say to yourself, \u201cStop this thought.\u201d With practice, thought stopping can help to disarm your negative critic and give balance to your emotional thoughts.

Aggressive behavior includes manipulation, intimidation, accusations, and perhaps \ufb01  ghting. There is little \nor no regard for other people\u2019s feelings. Aggressive behavior may result in personal gain, but also breeds loss of respect and trust in those who were walked over and bruised on the way. The aggres-sive style is thought to be anger driven.

This is the preferable \nstyle, in which a person focuses on speci\ufb01  c issues \nand problems, neither belittling him- or herself nor attacking others in the process of problem solving (McKay and Fanning, 2000).

Passive behavior style: A behavior in\ufb02  uenced \nby intimidation that can often lead to feelings of \nresentment and victimization.

Included under the rubric of communication are phone calls, emails, text messaging, blogging, lectures, staff meet-ings, dinner conversations, listening to radio and televi-sion, and simply talking with friends and acquaintances. The degree of perception and interpretation required for communication, and the many layers of meaning in even common words, leaves much room for misunder-standing\u2014and hence stress. This is why the practice of good communication skills is so important to help mini-mize and resolve misunderstandings. Good communi-cation skills are essential as a coping technique. To be a good communicator, one must not only express thoughts and feelings in understandable words, but also listen, clarify, and process information as it is intended. Communication skills are so important in the business world that workshops and seminars are given regularly on this topic; poor communication skills are simply not cost-effective. As you will see in this chapter, almost every theory and accompanying skill is based on com-mon sense. Yet common sense is often bound and gagged when the ego is threatened.

Best Application of Journal Writing\nGood-quality journal writing has several purposes. The \ufb01 rst is to act as a personal sounding board\u2014to cleanse \nthe mind overloaded with perceptions, emotions, and toxic thoughts. Journal writing is a great way to vent anger. In moments of rage, a verbal description helps pinpoint how and why these feelings are surfacing. Sometimes writing how you feel, and perhaps what you should have said or would like to say, becomes a draft script to resolve issues between you and the person(s) involved in your perceived stress. Writing down feel-ings of anxiety and apprehension is a good release of emotions that can drain your energy. Effective coping involves the ability to access and employ both internal and external resources. The second purpose is to map out strategies for resolu-\ntion, both attitudinal perceptions and behavioral changes. Depending on the situation, these two pur-poses can be used as an offensive tactic in the face of stress, or in strategic planning when in momentary retreat. As an offensive tactic, journal writing can be used to cope with an immediate problem. Just by pull-ing out a pad of paper and pen and writing down what is on your mind, thoughts become organized and order begins to emerge from chaos. In many stressful events, however, this option is not possible. Then journal writ-ing can be used as a postponed coping response, perhaps at the end of the day, to collect your thoughts and pro-cess major events\u2014those chronic stressors\u2014that need attention. Last, a periodic review of journal entries serves to increase awareness of trends and patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Recognition of trends is the \ufb01  rst step in changing undesired or negative thoughts and actions in an effort to reach your highest human potential and enjoy inner peace. Although the primary resource needed for journal writing is a single notebook, you might consider having two: one very private one to be used exclusively at home, and a second one, perhaps less structured, to be used at work. Personal computers have added a whole new dimen-\nsion to journal writing that was inconceivable just two decades ago. Many people have found that using a word processor actually allows them to write as fast as they think, thereby enabling them to capture the essence of several thoughts simultaneously, rather than \ufb01  ghting to retrieve some. If you \ufb01  nd it easier to type entries in a personal computer \ufb01  le than in a note-book, give it a try. 240\n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   24056147_CH10_229_243.indd   240 9/29/08   11:07:17 PM9/29/08   11:07:17 PM241 Journal Writing\nI Journal writing has been used as a form of self-\nexpression and soul searching for centuries. Psycho-logists and health educators have advocated journal writing for decades as a means to increase self-awareness on issues that need attention. I Journal writing is said to promote emotional catharsis when thoughts, perceptions, attitudes, values, beliefs, and the tensions these create are allowed to work themselves out on paper. I Use of soul searching is no coincidence as a stress-management technique because this activity is the epitome of the emptying process. I There are short-term and long-term effects of habitual journal writing. Short-term bene\ufb01  ts \ninclude releasing pent-up feelings of anger and anxiety. When a series of journal entries is reread, long-term effects include seeing patterns and habits of thought, perceptions, and behaviors that are not detectable on an entry-to-entry basis. Putting thoughts down on paper also widens one\u2019s perspective to become more receptive to solutions and resolutions to stressors. I An additional bene\ufb01  t, demonstrated by \nPennebaker, is that writing about personal expe-riences in a journal increases the integrity of the immune system. Expressive writing has also proved to bene\ufb01  t \ufb01 bromyalsia patients, wives of \nU.S. servicemen, as well as decrease resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels. I Not all journal entries have to be written in prose form. Poetry therapy is likened to making order out of personal chaos. This coping style is used in many settings, including prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, and counseling centers. I There is no wrong way to write a journal, save writing too infrequently. This chapter gave a number of guidelines for effective journal writ-ing, including several themes (Buzan, dreams, and unsent letters) that can add variety to your repertoire of entry styles.SUMMARY\nSTUDY GUIDE QUESTIONS\n 1.

First, if you feel you\u2019re\nsocially inexperienced all around, you can simply find ways to spend more\ntime soc ializing. This method is unstructured, but you\u2019ll still learn new\nthings from all the extra hours you\u2019ll rack up, and hone a varie ty of skills. Y ou can\nsocialize more with the people you already know (existing friends,\ncoworkers, classmates, roommates, family members);\nget a job that involves lots of interaction with people (for example,retail, restaurant server , bartender , call center , sales);\nsign up for a volunteer position that involves socializing (for\nexample, fundraising, talking to seniors, helping out at a festival);\njoin a club, team, or or ganization;\nattend online-or ganized meet-ups (for example, from a forum you\nuse, through sites like Meetup.com);\ntake advantage of natural opportunities to have brief, friendly\ninteractions with people who are generally expected to be pleasant\nand chat with you, such as store clerks and restaurant servers;\ngo to a venue where people can show up alone and be social with the\nother patrons (for example, a board game caf\u00e9, a pub or pool hall);\ninteract with people online (for example, chatting with people while\nplaying a multiplayer game). Of course, this can\u2019 t be a complete\nsubstitute for face-to-face practice, but it shouldn\u2019 t be dismissed\nentirely either; or\nif it\u2019 s a realistic option, travel and stay in busy , social hostels. A second method is to practice in a deliberate, structured way , especially\nif you want to work on specific skills. For example, if you h ave trouble\nstarting conversations, you could attend one online-or ganized meet-up a\nweek an d talk to at least five n ew people each time. If you have trouble\nwith a specific type of interaction, like inviting someone out or turning\ndown an unreasonable request, you could practice by role-playing the\nscenario with a friend or fa mily member . Some or ganizations and\ncounseling agencies run social skills training groups that provide\nopportunities to practice in a safe, supportive environment. A third way to practice socially  is to take a class to learn a performance-\noriented interper sonal skill like public speaking, acting, or improv or stand-\nup comedy .

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>Writer\u2019s block happens to every-\none at some point. Many people go in cycles, where they write religiously for months at a time, get a block, and then abandon their journals for a stretch. Sometime later, they come back to this coping style after a hiatus of a few weeks to a month. Writer\u2019s block can be overcome by trying a new approach or theme to journal entries, includ-ing creative writing or entries in the form of letters. For example, the book The Color Purple  was written as a \nseries of letters by author Alice Walker to a \ufb01  ctitious sis-\nter in Africa. If you \ufb01  nd yourself with writer\u2019s block, try a new format of writing. In his book Opening Up: The Healing Power of Con\ufb01  ding \nin Others, author Jamie Pennebaker advocates journal \nwriting as a means of self-expression. Just as there can be bene\ufb01  ts to journal writing, however, it can also be used incorrectly, negating the potential personal gains to be made. The following are suggestions to keep in mind when using journal writing as a positive coping technique:\n 1. Journal writing should not be used to replace a more  \nviable coping technique\n. Journals can be great sound-\ning boards. The echoes from these passages should be a strong personal invitation to \ufb01  nd solutions to the problem at hand. Remember, for a coping tech-nique to be effective, it must work toward a peace-ful resolution. When journal writing is employed in place of more appropriate coping techniques, such as effective communication with other people (Chapter 14) or social engineering of factors for the betterment of your environment (Chapter 16), reso-lution is compromised, if not completely prevented, and full closure on stressors never comes. 2. Journal writing should encourage, not discourage, honest feelings. As a coping technique, journal writing invites the writer to soul-search and turn thoughts inward. Although many writing themes, concepts, and philosophies can be used as vehicles to explore and augment the soul-searching pro-cess, these should not be the speci\ufb01  c focus of one\u2019s \nwriting. The primary theme is the writer. Ideally, journals should be kept con\ufb01\n dential, though often \npeople choose to share parts of journal entries, sometimes entire passages. However, if journal entries are written for an audience other than yourself, then the likelihood of honesty is greatly compromised.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>What discou raging or self-critical thoughts are\nyou having about it?

When dissec ting each\nthought, imagine it\u2019 s something  a friend told you they were feeling about\nthemselves or a statement your worst enemy made to you. Y ou\u2019ll often\nuncritically accept ideas from your own mind that you would question\ninstantly if they came from an outside source. Y ou could also try \u201cexternalizi ng\u201d your issues. Instead of se eing your\nanxiety or insecurity as a core part of you, view it as an outside entity that\nhas taken up residence in your mind and is trying to sabo tage it (for\nexample, picture it as a cartoony demon). Next, ask several questions of each thought and see how well it holds up:\nWhat is  the overall tone of the thought? Sometimes you\u2019ll have\nthoughts that are technically accurate and free of distortions, but\nyou\u2019re still being way too harsh and unsympathetic toward yourself. Is there a cognitive distortion, self-ef facing attribution, or unhelpful\nbelief in the thought? Do you have a ny evidence that the thought is accurate and true?</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Awareness. In the awareness stage, you realize that you actually think or behave in a certain way that is unhealthy or less than ideal. In the context of this book, these behaviors are stress-producing habits. Awareness may come about as a result of some educational experience (e.g., a class, public service advertising, a newspaper article, journal writing, or the advice of a close friend) wherein your consciousness is raised about a certain behav-ior. Aware ness can also occur when you simply \nadmit that one (or more) of your current behav-iors is no longer desirable. Once you see this undesirable behavior in yourself (e.g., codepen-dent tendencies such as ardent approval seeking and victimization, or Type A behaviors including hostile aggression), the process of change can begin. 2.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

A common\nscenario is for someone to work to overcome their social fear , go on to\nachieve their other interpersonal goals, and then \u201cget out of sha pe\u201d because\nthey no longer need to deal wit h the old challenge. For examp le, someone\nwith fears around initiating co nversations and inviting peop le out gets\ncomfortable with those skills, makes a bunch of friends, and no longer\nneeds to  meet anyone new . If they want to freshen up their s ocial circle\nyears down the road, they ma y find they\u2019re nervous about a pproaching\npeople again.8\nI n c r e a s i n g  Y o u r  S e l f - E s t e e m  a n d  C o n f i d e n c e\nL OW  SELF - CONFIDENCE  LIES  at th e root of many people\u2019 s shyness, social\nanxiety , and insecurities. This chapter addresses the most important points\nfor improving your self-confid ence (aside from the concepts that have\nalready been covered, like how  to dispute counterproductive thoughts) by\ncovering two concepts that both  fall under the term \u201cself-confid ence.\u201d The\nfirst is core self-esteem, which is your overall assessment of your worth as a\nperson. The second is how self-assured, competent, and brave you feel in\nspecific social situations\u2014your situational confidence (for example, \u201cI feel\nconfident about how I\u2019ll do at the party tonight\u201d). Having high self-esteem gives y ou strengths that will override aspects of\nshyness, anxiety , insecurity , and pessimism. People with high self-esteem\nfeel good about themselves and what they have to of fer , are more optimistic\nand mor e prepar ed to take risks , and are better able to tolerate uncertainty ,\ndiscomfort, and rejection. Their positive feelings about themselves are\nstable an d come  from within, an d their emotions don\u2019 t constantly go up and\ndown based on outside factors, like whether enough people sm iled at them\nin the hallway th at day . Having a  healthy level of self-esteem do es not mean\nbeing ar rogant, boastful, and entitled. That mentality is damaging and may\nbe an indication of deeper feelings of inferiority; it\u2019 s not true self-esteem at\nall. Having situation al confidence is similarly helpful. Y ou\u2019ll feel c almer and\nsurer of yoursel f, you\u2019ll perform better , you\u2019ll have an easier time putting\nyourself out there, and you\u2019ll tend to make a better impression on others.W a y s  t o  i n c r e a s e  y o u r  c o r e  s e l f - e s t e e m\nThere\u2019 s no one path to increasi ng your core self-esteem. Rather there are\nmany things you can do that add up to feeling more sure of yourself. Practice self-acceptance and r ealize it\u2019 s okay to be a normal, less-than-\nperfect person\nThe foundation of good self-esteem is realizing you\u2019re okay t he way you\nare. People sometimes imagine t hat if they had high self-esteem , they\u2019d feel\ncocksure and amped up all the ti me, but having good self-esteem feels more\nlike a deep, sol id level of com fort with yourself. Y ou\u2019re aware of your\npersonality traits  and quirks, you r strengths and weaknesses, your successes\nand failures, and you\u2019re fine w ith the overall package they create. The\nfollowing factors play into being self-accepting:\nRealizing that it\u2019 s all right to  be a r egular human who makes\nmistakes and isn\u2019t perfect. Everyone gets things wrong sometimes,\nand it doesn\u2019 t mean they\u2019re broken through and through. Setting r ealistic standards for yourself and letting go of\nperfectionism. People with low self-esteem sometimes believe they\nwon\u2019 t be able to  feel good about themselves unless they becom e an\noverachieving superhuman who\u2019 s the complete opposite of how they\nare now . Being nice and compassiona te to yourself . Accepting yourself\nmeans being on your own side. If you mess up, you can look at the\nsituation with an understanding eye, rather than tearing into yourself. People are sometimes wary abo ut the idea of being self-accepti ng. Being\nself-accepting doesn\u2019 t mean you  have to condone or approve of everything\nyou do wrong o r embrace all y our flaws. However , when you do make amistake, you don\u2019 t need to dis own everything about yourself . But don\u2019 t\nthink yo u need to abandon all d esire to change or improve you rself either . Instead, acknowledge that there are areas in your life you\u2019d benefit from\nworking on. The well-known sa ying is \u201cY ou\u2019re fine the way you are\u2026 and\nthere\u2019 s a lways ro om for improvement.\u201d When you accept yourself, personal\ndevelopment is something you choose to do because you see how it will add\nto your life, instead of viewing it as something you have  to do to stay a few\nsteps ahead of your supposed intrinsic shamefulness. Similarly , being more self-accepting doesn\u2019 t mean you\u2019ll become content\nin your rut and lose all desire to grow and achieve. If something is truly\nimportant to you, you\u2019ll still go  after it. It\u2019 s human nature to keep moving\nforward. Howev er , you may find yourself losing interest in goals that were\nmostly a means of gaining faux  self-esteem. For example, someone might\nretain their desire to become an artist because it makes them happy to\ndevelop their creative potential, but be less motivated to own a n expensive\nwardrobe, because they didn\u2019 t want it for anything other than to impress\npeople. Question the negative messages you\u2019ve internalized about your value as\na person\nA core reason people develop low self-esteem is that at some point in their\nlives, they came to believe they  were fundamentally defective. Usually this\nis becau se of messages they received and took to heart when they were\nyoung and impressionable.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

Group conversations can also be a bit annoying\nto follow at times, like if many people are talking at once or if theenvironment is loud. Sometimes it seems easier to give up and  not devote\nyour ful l attention to what the others are saying. W ith practice, you can get\nbetter at keeping focused during group conversations.

Typically, people start out writing a \ncouple of paragraphs mainly emphasizing events of the day rather than perceptions of these events. If contin-ued, however, entries become longer, with more ele-ments of the author\u2019s personality. The current school of thought suggests that there really \nare no rules on keeping a journal. However, as an effec-tive coping technique, there are some things to keep in mind. A journal should include descriptions of both stressful events and positive experiences. Life is full of highs and lows, and over the course of time, your jour-nal should re\ufb02  ect both sides of the emotional teeter-tot-ter. In addition, journal writing is not limited to thoughts and feelings expressed solely in words. Drawings serve as a wonderful expression of feelings, thoughts, and memories that words often cannot fully describe. Sketches also help augment recollections of images to complement the written text (see Chapter 11, \u201cExpressive Art Therapy\u201d). It is important for you to remember that you write for yourself and not for the pleasure or intent of others. In fact, the best journal entries are those that are completely con\ufb01  dential. The \npremise of journal writing is to strengthen the bond of honesty from your mind to your soul. The contents of a stress-reduction journal aren\u2019t for publication; thus they are and should remain con\ufb01  dential. Thoughts should be articulated, yet unedited. When this premise is acted on, thoughts and feelings become easier to articulate and the rewards of inner peace are more substantial. Although there is no speci\ufb01  c formula for successful \njournal writing, some criteria may aid the writer to use \nthis coping strategy to deal more effectively with per-ceived stress. These include the following:\n 1.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Consider keeping a section of your journal for \ncreative ideas, doodling, and photo collages. Best Application of Journal Writing\nGood-quality journal writing has several purposes. The \ufb01 rst is to act as a personal sounding board\u2014to cleanse \nthe mind overloaded with perceptions, emotions, and toxic thoughts. Journal writing is a great way to vent anger. In moments of rage, a verbal description helps pinpoint how and why these feelings are surfacing. Sometimes writing how you feel, and perhaps what you should have said or would like to say, becomes a draft script to resolve issues between you and the person(s) involved in your perceived stress. Writing down feel-ings of anxiety and apprehension is a good release of emotions that can drain your energy. Effective coping involves the ability to access and employ both internal and external resources. The second purpose is to map out strategies for resolu-\ntion, both attitudinal perceptions and behavioral changes. Depending on the situation, these two pur-poses can be used as an offensive tactic in the face of stress, or in strategic planning when in momentary retreat. As an offensive tactic, journal writing can be used to cope with an immediate problem. Just by pull-ing out a pad of paper and pen and writing down what is on your mind, thoughts become organized and order begins to emerge from chaos. In many stressful events, however, this option is not possible. Then journal writ-ing can be used as a postponed coping response, perhaps at the end of the day, to collect your thoughts and pro-cess major events\u2014those chronic stressors\u2014that need attention. Last, a periodic review of journal entries serves to increase awareness of trends and patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Recognition of trends is the \ufb01  rst step in changing undesired or negative thoughts and actions in an effort to reach your highest human potential and enjoy inner peace. Although the primary resource needed for journal writing is a single notebook, you might consider having two: one very private one to be used exclusively at home, and a second one, perhaps less structured, to be used at work. Personal computers have added a whole new dimen-\nsion to journal writing that was inconceivable just two decades ago. Many people have found that using a word processor actually allows them to write as fast as they think, thereby enabling them to capture the essence of several thoughts simultaneously, rather than \ufb01  ghting to retrieve some. If you \ufb01  nd it easier to type entries in a personal computer \ufb01  le than in a note-book, give it a try. 240\n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   24056147_CH10_229_243.indd   240 9/29/08   11:07:17 PM9/29/08   11:07:17 PM241 Journal Writing\nI Journal writing has been used as a form of self-\nexpression and soul searching for centuries. Psycho-logists and health educators have advocated journal writing for decades as a means to increase self-awareness on issues that need attention. I Journal writing is said to promote emotional catharsis when thoughts, perceptions, attitudes, values, beliefs, and the tensions these create are allowed to work themselves out on paper. I Use of soul searching is no coincidence as a stress-management technique because this activity is the epitome of the emptying process. I There are short-term and long-term effects of habitual journal writing. Short-term bene\ufb01  ts \ninclude releasing pent-up feelings of anger and anxiety. When a series of journal entries is reread, long-term effects include seeing patterns and habits of thought, perceptions, and behaviors that are not detectable on an entry-to-entry basis. Putting thoughts down on paper also widens one\u2019s perspective to become more receptive to solutions and resolutions to stressors. I An additional bene\ufb01  t, demonstrated by \nPennebaker, is that writing about personal expe-riences in a journal increases the integrity of the immune system. Expressive writing has also proved to bene\ufb01  t \ufb01 bromyalsia patients, wives of \nU.S. servicemen, as well as decrease resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels. I Not all journal entries have to be written in prose form. Poetry therapy is likened to making order out of personal chaos. This coping style is used in many settings, including prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, and counseling centers. I There is no wrong way to write a journal, save writing too infrequently. This chapter gave a number of guidelines for effective journal writ-ing, including several themes (Buzan, dreams, and unsent letters) that can add variety to your repertoire of entry styles.SUMMARY\nSTUDY GUIDE QUESTIONS\n 1.

Here are some of the more well-recognized theo-ries of human behavior as applied to the practice of behavior modi\ufb01  cation. Understanding the nature of these theories may help you to modify your behavior. Classical Conditioning. The concept of classical condi-\ntioning was \ufb01  rst described by Russian physiologist Ivan  \nPavlov in the late 1920s. Pavlov\u2019s theory, based on his\n \nresearch with dogs, suggests that animals become condi-\ntioned to speci\ufb01  c stimuli to act in a speci\ufb01  c way. What Pavlov observed was that his dogs began to salivate when they heard a bell that they associated with food. People, like dogs, can also become conditioned to behave in a cer-tain way. In this regard, when a stimulus is coupled with a physiological re\ufb02  ex, the result can be a behavior with some pretty deep roots, one that can take years to unlearn. I am reminded of a student of mine who, upon listening to a relaxation tape with the natural sound of a brook, felt the undeniable urge to go to the bathroom. Slightly embarrassed, she approached me after class and told me that she felt very uncomfortable with the tape. When she was a young child, she told me, her mother, who often was in a hurry to do shopping or errands, would run the water in the bathroom to get her to urinate quickly. Now whenever she hears running water, she gets the urge to go to the bathroom. Operant Conditioning.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Maybe\nthey\u2019d b e up for doing something one weekend. Just because you\u2019re out of\nschool, new to town, or older doesn\u2019 t necessarily mean you have no existing\nsocial connectio ns. Even if you\u2019ve moved somewhere far away , you may\nhave a past acqu aintance or relative in the area. Maybe you cou ld meet that\nold buddy for lunch and be introduced to their friends soon after . Pursue your hobbies as a way to meet people\nWhen y ou\u2019re in university , you can meet lots of friends through your\nclasses, living arrangements, and part-time jobs. If you m eet anyone\nthrough a hobby , it\u2019 s almost a bonus. After college is over , your interests\nbecome a lot more central to your social life. People who have a lot of\nsocial hobbies have an easier time making friends. If they\u2019re settling down\nin a new city , it \u2019 s natural for th em to join a bunch of teams, get involved\nwith a theater g roup, or start v olunteering somewhere. Before long, they\nhave a social circle. It\u2019 s harder for people who have more solita ry interests\nlike reading, watching movies, or going for long hikes by themselves. Consider getting  some more soc ial hobbies if you don\u2019 t already  have any . Y ou don \u2019 t need to totally overhaul your personality or all of yo ur pastimes,\nbut tweak how you spend your  time so you can meet as man y friends as\nyou\u2019d lik e. Do more activities o utside of the house. Find a way to use your\nexisting hobbies to put you in contact with more people. For example, if\nyou normally exercise at home, join a class or running club. If you like\nreading about new ideas, attend some free talks or seminars, or join a book\ndiscussion club. If you like stand-up comedy , see if there are any Internet\nmeet-ups where fans can arrange to go to shows together . Be mor e active about seizing opportunities with potential friendsWhen you\u2019re in college, you can af ford to be a bit lazy about making\nfriends. If you meet someone yo u get along with in one of your  classes but\ndon\u2019 t pursue the relationship as hard as you could have, it\u2019 s no t the end of\nthe world. Y ou\u2019ll probably see them again in the next eight weeks. And if it\ndoesn\u2019 t work out with them, there are tons of other prospects. When you\u2019re\nno longe r in college, the opportu nities don\u2019 t pop up as often. Y ou have to be\na little more on top of things when it comes to following up with people you\nhit it of f with. Sure, at your job or at the start  of a league\u2019 s season, you can drag your\nfeet, but  there will often be tim es when you\u2019ll meet a possible friend only\nonce or twice, and if you don\u2019 t jump on the chance, you\u2019ll lose it. A lot of\nhobby-related ve nues like dance classes or rock-climbing gyms have people\nwho onl y drop in a handful of times and then move on. When  you meet a\nperson y ou coul d imagine yourself being friends with and there\u2019 s a chance\nyou may not cross paths with them again, be more active about getting their\ncontact information. Then follow up on the lead fairly quickly . Expand the range of people you could possibly be friends with\nWhen y ou\u2019re sti ll in high schoo l and college, you mostly form friendships\nwith peo ple arou nd your age an d from a similar background. A s you move\nthrough adultho od, the range of  people you meet and could hang out with\nincreases. Don\u2019 t  be too quick to dismiss someone who\u2019 s older or younger\nbecause they don\u2019 t fit what you imagined your social circle would look like. Just bec ause so meone\u2019 s age is a decade up or down from yo urs doesn\u2019 t\nautomatically mean you have nothing in common, or that they\u2019 re silly and\nimmature, or stodgy and out of touch.

In the cre-ative minds of his patients, the white blood cells took on metaphorical images of armies of white knights in shin-ing armor or schools of great white sharks in confronta-tion with their prey. Simonton had several patients draw pictures of these images to reinforce the power of visualization. Additional pictures were drawn at vari-ous stages of their illnesses. The progression of visual images gave striking evidence of the patients\u2019 attitudes toward their disease and their willingness to attempt to either augment the healing process through enhanced willpower and positive attitudes (with some cases of \u201cterminal\u201d cancer going into remission) or remain pas-sive, even helpless, victims. In her pioneering work, K\u00fcbler-Ross (1981) has also \nused art as a therapeutic tool with children who have cancer. Those with a limited vocabulary but total lack of inhibition about drawing were able to express a mul-titude of feelings surrounding the many progressions of the death process. K\u00fcbler-Ross found that the utiliza-tion of illustrations and sketches by terminally ill chil-dren served as a phenomenal coping technique toward the resolution of the emotional and spiritual stress asso-ciated with this traumatic experience. She believes that self-expression through art has the potential to become a vehicle to promote wholeness in the individual. Using an approach similar to Simonton\u2019s and K\u00fcbler-\nRoss\u2019s, physician Bernie Siegel (1986) also has employed art therapy among his cancer patients. Whereas most physicians have their patients \ufb01  rst \ufb01  ll out medical-\nhistory questionnaires, Siegel hands out blank sheets of white paper and boxes of crayons and asks individuals to draw themselves in their current state of health or disease. According to Siegel, mental imagery in the form of art therapy is more useful than a battery of labo-ratory tests to assess a patient\u2019s disease state and pros-pects for recovery. He adds that the analysis of these illustrations is one of the most accurate tools in deter-mining the prognosis of disease and, potentially, the development of other health-related problems. As a general surgeon with a speciality in oncology, \nSiegel was struck by several factors hinting at which patients would succumb to their disease and which would defy the odds of terminal cancer. Those who seemed to grab the bull by the horns and took responsi-bility for their recovery he referred to as exceptional cancer patients (ECaP). More speci\ufb01  cally, critical fac-tors included will power, humor, hope, and love, all of Chapter 11\n248\nFacing radiation (and possible sur-\ngery) for breast cancer, this stu-\ndent chose to imagine the radiation as light energy that would heal her body. \u201cUnlike some women who are forever worrying about their body image, I am very proud of my body,\u201d she explained.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Adoption and substitution. The most dif\ufb01  cult part \nof any attitudinal change is its implementation. Once a new frame of mind is created, it must then be adopted and implemented. Humans tend to be creatures of habit, \ufb01\n nding comfort in known enti-\nties even if the \u201cknown\u201d is less than desirable. Pessimism is a defense mechanism, and although it is not seen as enhancing human potential, there is comfort in the familiarity of old ways, and change does not come easily. There are risks involved in change. Substituting a positive atti-tude for a negative perception may make you feel vulnerable at \ufb01  rst, but like other skills that improve with practice, a new comfort will emerge. With cognitive restructuring, the new mind frame must often be substituted when the stress is encountered, and repeated again and again.Chapter 8\n212Over the years I have asked various people for their de\ufb01  -\nnitions of optimists and pessimists. All clich\u00e9s aside, \nhere are some of their answers:\nAn optimist is someone who:\nI sees the positive, even in a bad situation.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>If there were, th ey\u2019d be common knowledge, and this book\nwouldn\u2019 t be needed. Knowing what ar e you working on when you practice your social skills\nAs you practice  socializing, you\u2019ll develop the following overall abilities. In s ome interactions, you\u2019ll d raw on only a few of them, while other\ninteractions will require you to juggle many at a time. 1) Y our ability to think on your feet. When it\u2019 s your turn to say\nsomething, you can\u2019 t take forever to come up with your response. Also,\naside from the relatively predic table first minute or two, inter actions can\nquickly go in countless directions. It\u2019 s unfeasible to try to plan out\neverything you\u2019 re going to say ahead of time or map out how  to handle\nevery scenario in advance. Th e best you can do is learn so me general\nguidelines and then sharpen your ability to improvise. 2) Y our ability to multitask. When you\u2019re interacting with so meone, you\nhave to continu ally attend to s everal things at once. The othe r person is\nconstantly sending signals through their words, actions, and nonverbal\ncommunication; you have to take it in, evaluate it, and decide on the fly\nhow to act on your conclusions (\u201cThey just said they\u2019re not familiar with\ncycling. I\u2019ll have to adjust how I tell my anecdote.\u201d). At the sam e time, you\nhave to manage the signals you\u2019re sending (\u201cI\u2019m curious about what time it\nis, b ut I won\u2019 t check my watch now because it may make me lo ok like I\u2019m\nnot inter ested in their story .\u201d). A s you get better at socializing, taking in all\nof that informa tion and deciding what to do with it starts to feel less\noverwhelming. 3) Y our pr oficiency in a variety of concr ete subskills like listening,\nasserting yourself, or phrasing  an invitation. Like with any s kill, at first\nyou\u2019ll be clumsy and exaggerate d when you listen actively , ass ert yourself,\nor ex tend an invitation, but in time you\u2019ll develop a defter touch and be ableto c alibrate your behavior to t he situation at hand. For example, when\nyou\u2019re f irst getting the hang of  listening skills, you may sometimes come\nacross as an over -the-top therapist. W ith more practice, you\u2019ll be able to\nshow you care and that you\u2019re paying attention in a more subtle way . 4) Y our comfort level with va rious subskills, like making eye contact\nor starting conversations. S ome subskills, like making eye contact or\ninitiating a conversation, will m ake you feel nervous or unnat ural at first,\nbut the more you do them, the more normal they\u2019ll feel. 5) Y our general knowledge of people, what makes them tick , and how\nthey tend to r eact to various things . Every person is dif ferent, but w ith\nenough social experience, you\u2019ll start to notice broad patterns you can act\non. F or example, you may notice that people who are into a certain hobby\nalso tend to share the same political beliefs and conversation style, and you\ncan adjust accordingly . 6) Y our knowledge of various  social situations and how to  navigate\nthem. Y ou can learn th is through firsthand experience or by observing other\npeople who are more socially experienced than you. It\u2019 s poss ible to find\nadvice on common scenarios, like how to approach people at a party or turn\ndown an unreasonable request,  but in your day-to-day life, you\u2019ll come\nacross o ther sce narios that are too rare and esoteric to end up in any book. When y ou come  across these no vel situations, you may not always handle\nthem pe rfectly , but with time you can build up an overall sense  about how\nto approach them. 7) Y our knowledge of the unwritten social guidelines of your\nparticular cultur e, subcultur e, or gr oup of friends, and how  to adjust\nthe general communication-skills rules to fit them. This is another reason\nit\u2019 s impo ssible t o explain how to deal with every situation ahead of time. What may be co nsidered an appealing conversation style in one  country or\namong o ne circl e of friends may  be seen as obnoxious elsewher e. The onlyway to learn the rules for your social context is to be in it and observe them\nfor yourself. 8) Constructive mind-sets toward socializing. A well-intentioned, but\nunhelpful, variet y of social advic e is to suggest you adopt useful, but easier -\nsaid-than-done, mind-sets like, \u201cDon\u2019 t care too much about people\u2019 s\nopinions of you\u201d or \u201cJust go out to have fun and don\u2019 t fret abo ut how well\nyou soci alize.\u201d It\u2019 s great if you  can think like this, but you do n\u2019 t instantly\nacquire those worldviews just b y reading they\u2019re good to have. Instead, as\nyou soc ialize more and more, you\u2019ll have many small experiences and\nsuccesses that show firsthand these are good ways to think,  and you\u2019ll\ngradually add them into your worldview . 9) Y our personal social style. There ar e some general guidelin es for what\nmakes fo r a better or worse inte raction, but there isn\u2019 t a single right way to\nsocialize. Everyone has his or her own personality and strengths and\nweaknesses.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

Moreover, people, particularly young adults, are changing their communication styles about as quickly as the technol-ogy that they communicate with changes. Ironically, young people (from middle school to graduate school) send text messages, email, and voice mail, often while in proximity of the person with whom they are communi-cating. For some it\u2019s a whole new language (e.g., LOL, 4EAE, and BTDT). For many, it\u2019s the preferred way to communicate. But instant messaging doesn\u2019t mean an instant reply, despite expectations to make it so. Unmet expectations often result in frustration (stress!). If young people aren\u2019t instant messaging or sending email, they are keyboarding information through their MySpace page or Facebook page. In fact, so new are the changes in technology that few studies have been done to under-stand the rami\ufb01  cations of how communication skills affect relationships when convenience holds a greater priority than content. But this we do know: Email doesn\u2019t convey voice intonation. Text messages don\u2019t convey body language (an important part of communi-cations), and voice mail can\u2019t replace eye contact. All this means that much is lost in translation. As such, the potential for stress in interpersonal relationships is increased dramatically when incomplete forms of com-munication are used. Poor communication skills of one\u2019s thoughts and feelings not only affect roommates, spouses, children, and colleagues; the ripple effect goes beyond the family and worksite to the entire commu-nity, as was observed with the Virginia Tech massacre. Despite the rapid advances in technology and how we employ these means to express ourselves, the basics of communication skills remain the same. The Basics of Communication Skills\nIf you were to make a list of your top ten stressors, you would probably \ufb01  nd that at least half of these involve relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Strong relationships necessitate good communication skills. To paraphrase poet John Donne, \u201cNo man is an island entire of itself.

This chapter lay s out the factors that lead to friendships\nbecoming closer . The concepts described below often happen automatically\nas a  friendship progresses, b ut you can take some control of your\nrelationships by deliberately try ing to use these points. They mainly apply\nto in dividual friends, but some of them also carry over to becom ing tighter\nwith a group. Some things to know going in:\nTher e\u2019 s no formula to becoming better friends with everybody you\nmeet\nNot everyone you meet is going to want to hang out with you. And even if\nyou get along on  a surface level,  not everyone you hang out with is going to\nbecome a closer friend. W e\u2019re just not compatible with mos t people in\nterms o f availability , interests, values, and what we\u2019re looking for in a\nfriendship. Alth ough you can t ry to apply the ideas below to your new\nfriends, realize they\u2019re not all going to go the distance and b ecome your\nsoul mates. That\u2019 s okay though, because people are often enjo yable to be\naround on a more casual basis. On t he same not e, just because y ou may be able to successfully apply one\nor m ore of the ideas below to so meone, that won\u2019 t guarantee the friendship\nis g oing to go anywhere. For example, you may have a rea lly intimateconversation with them, but overall they\u2019ll continue to think of you as\nsomeone they run into every now and then. If you\u2019re making an ef fort to\nbecome better friends with som eone and you get the sense you\u2019re putting\nmore en er gy int o it than they are, consider backing of f and adjusting your\nexpectations. Sometimes you\u2019ll become good friends with someone pr etty quickly; at\nother times it takes a while\nMany p eople have had the e xperience of meeting someone new and\nimmediately sta rting to hang ou t with them nearly every day . Just as many\nhave frie ndships where the bond grew more gradually . Neither progression\nis be tter than th e other . Friendships can get of f the ground quickly in the\nfollowing situations:\nwhen you just click with a person unusually well;\nwhen yo u\u2019re bo th at a place in your lives where you\u2019re looking for\nnew friends (for example, during the first weeks of college);\nwhen you\u2019re both available and easily accessible to each other (for\nexample, you live in the same building and have lots of free time to\nhang out);\nwhen you fulfill an unmet need in each other \u2019 s lives (for exa mple,\nyou absolutely love reading and  discussing books, but none of  your\nother friends care much about them);\nwhen you\u2019re in a situation whe re the usual standards for frien dship\nprogression don\u2019 t apply , like when you meet people while trav eling\nand feel like friends for life after knowing them for only five days. Friendships can grow more slowly\nwhen on e or both of you are pretty busy with your day-to-day livesand/or already have many friends who fill up your calendar;\nwhen yo u get along well enough, but there isn\u2019 t that instant spa rk of\nintense compatibility;\nwhen you\u2019re not actively trying to deepen your friendship with them. For example, they\u2019re on the per iphery of your social circle, and  you\nget to know them better here and there. It\u2019 s natural to feel a bit awkward and insecur e as a new friendship\nbegins\nThere ar e times when you\u2019ll hit  it of f with someone right away and never\nfeel uncomforta ble around them. There are also those times where your\nfriendships will develop in a low-stakes, almost accidental way . However ,\nsometimes the process is more nerve-racking, like if you meet someone at a\none-of f event and then actively try to start a friendship with them. Here it\u2019 s\nunderstandable t hat things will feel uncertain because you\u2019re not sure how\nmuch they like y ou or if you\u2019ll continue to get along and have things to say\nto each other . It usually takes a month or so before you start to feel more\nrelaxed and secure about the relationship. W a y s  t o  d e v e l o p  a  n e w  f r i e n d s h i p\nEvery fr iendship is dif ferent, and not every point will apply to every type\nequally . Some friendships are more about sharing and connec ting, while\nothers are based around hobbies, joking around, and going out at night. Spend mor e time together\nSimply spending more time with someone is the backbone of becoming\nbetter friends with them. A close relationship isn\u2019 t something that happens\nin a few hours. Y ou need spac e for all the relationship-enhancing thingscovered below to happen. T ime is an important enough factor that we often\nbecome good friends with the people we naturally have a lot of contact\nwith, lik e coworkers, friends of friends, classmates, and team members. W ith tim e, friendships can even develop between people who were initially\nindif ferent to each other . Make an effort to hang out with them r egularly\nThe main way to  spend enough time with someone is to hang out with them\nfairly often. Sometimes you\u2019ll b e in a situation where you\u2019ll automatically\nput in those hou rs. If not, you should try to use the ideas in t he previous\nchapter to or ganize get-togethe rs so you can continue seeing them. W ith\nsome people, you\u2019ll quickly fall into a routine of hanging out all the time. W ith oth ers, you  may only be able to get together every three weeks for a\nquick bite to eat. This step needs to be ongoing . It\u2019 s not about coordinating a one-time\nhangout. It\u2019 s about putting in th e ef fort to keep seeing them c ontinuously\nover a period of months. Y ou might have trouble here because:\nY ou\u2019re a  bit too busy or lazy , and don\u2019 t put in the work to see your\nnew friends regularly . Y ou\u2019re shy and reluctant to invi te someone to hang out becaus e you\nfear rejection or an awkward m oment. This most often comes up\nduring the first few invites, but may subtly af fect your actions later if\nyou believe your friend is \u201cabove\u201d you. Y ou\u2019re insecure and prone to thinking you\u2019re not worth ha nging\naround and your new friends must not really like you. Y ou don\u2019 t have the highest need to socialize, and it causes you to not\ninitiate get-togethers as often as needed to keep your new friendships\ngoing.Spend one-on-one time talking with them\nPeople can get to know each other and bond in a group setting, but often the\nreal opp ortunities to connect come when it\u2019 s just you and one o ther person. Also, if you haven\u2019 t hung out wi th someone on your own, how close is your\nfriendship really? Many people have known someone through group\noutings, but have seen a dif ferent side of them when they star ted hanging\nout as a pair . Th ey\u2019ll point to that as when their friendship real ly started to\ndevelop. Y ou could get that one -on-one time by arranging to do something\nwith the m separ ately . Y ou could also find moments to break of f with them\nfrom the  lar ger group. For exam ple, the two of you may be able to retreat to\nthe backyard to talk at a party . Keep up with them in between hanging out\nOne thin g that distinguishes closer friends from more casual ones is how\nmuch th ey stay in contact between times when they hang out in person. Good friends often keep in touch. More casual buddies think along the lines\nof, \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to see them when we run into each other in person, but I\ndon\u2019 t ne ed to keep up with them otherwise.\u201d Especially if you\u2019re not\nhanging out with your new friends all the time, keep up w ith them in\nbetween get-togethers. Send them a text making a joke or asking how their\nweek wa s, email them a link they may like, or call them on the phone to\ncatch up. T ake the ir response rate and their own ef forts to reach out to  you as a\ngauge of how often you should be in touch with them. Some people are\nhappy to text back and forth all day .</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>I can even suggest some good spots\u201d).</DOCUMENT>", "question": "1. What factors can lead to friendships becoming closer?", "gold_answer": "", "answer": ": The factors that can lead to friendships becoming closer include surrounding yourself with the right people, making an effort to hang out regularly, spending one-on-one time talking with them, keeping up with them in between hangouts, taking the initiative to spend time together, being available and flexible, being willing to put in the effort, being open to new experiences, being patient and persistent, and being willing to compromise and adapt."}

The Judge .</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Still others do it in a relaxed state through meditation and guided mental imagery. So, here is a question for you: What goals and aspirations do you have that are sabotaged by early childhood programming (e.g., trust issues, self-esteem issues, con\ufb01  dence, perceptions of leisure, money, or relationships)? How can you reprogram new (positive) thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions of yourself that can steer you in the direction and to the destination you wish to go? When you can answer these questions you have really discovered \u201cthe secret.\u201d\nToxic Thoughts\nNegative perceptions are often the result of low self- esteem. They also perpetuate it by suppressing or oblit-erating feelings of self-worth and self-acceptance. It has been suggested (Can\ufb01  eld, 1988; Ingerman, 2007) that toxic thoughts originate from repeated exposure to feel-ings of shame and guilt in early childhood. Can\ufb01  eld \ncites a study conducted at the University of Iowa where parent\u2013child interactions were observed over a period of several days. Results revealed that, on average, there were 400 negative comments for every positive one spo-ken to the child. It was concluded that negative thoughts are actually a conditioned (learned) response that is then carried into adulthood. Catastrophic thoughts are also reinforced in the messages we receive from the head-lines\u2014rarely does a human interest story beat a cata-clysmic event on the six o\u2019clock news. Disasters, world problems, and crimes permeate the news, which tends to condition our thinking toward the negative side of things. John-Roger even argues that negative thinking has an addictive quality to it. The term toxic thoughts was coined in the early 1980s \nby several psychologists to educate their clients about the dangers of negative thinking. Pessimism, a person-ality trait heavily grounded in negativism, promotes toxic thoughts. To demonstrate just how destructive they could be, Dr. Leslie Kaymen conducted a study at the University of Pennsylvania in 1989 to determine the phy siological responses to stress between individuals who identi\ufb01  ed themselves (through a psychological sur-vey) as either optimists or pessimists. All subjects were exposed to minute doses of pathogens (tetanus, mumps, and yeast), which, when placed on the skin, would indi-cate their stress-tolerance levels. Subjects were then \n204Chapter 8\nToxic thoughts: Repeated negative thought pro-\ncessing that tends to pollute our view of our lives and ourselves. 56147_CH08_195_215.indd   20456147_CH08_195_215.indd   204 10/1/08   11:03:58 AM10/1/08   11:03:58 AMCognitive Restructuring: Reframing\n205divided by attitude into two groups, and both groups \nwere given an impossible task to complete in a brief time period. While the pessimists quickly gave up, the optimists continued until the last possible moment. Days later, the PNI response (skin rashes) of the pessi-mists was signi\ufb01  cantly greater than that of the optimists. These results revealed that an optimistic attitude was associated with sound physical health, whereas a nega-tive attitude perpetuated the mental and physical stress response. In short, negative thoughts can have a toxic effect on the body. Kaymen\u2019s data analysis con\ufb01  rms the hypothesis that negative thinking can suppress the immune system. In an updated version of Kaymen\u2019s work, Andrew \nSteptoe and colleagues (2008) designed a study with nearly 3,000 subjects to examine the biological links of positive thoughts (mood). Results revealed that both men and women who reported experiencing a happy mood had lower cortisol levels, suggesting that happiness and optimism reduce biological vulnerability. Moreover, female subjects indicated signi\ufb01  cant decreased amounts \n205\nStress  with a Human Face\nA tribute to Allison Fisher: In \nthe spring of 1991, I had a remarkable student named \nAllison Fisher. Allison was bright, energetic, and beam-ing with success. At the midpoint of each semester, I invite my students to do an exercise called \u201cConfronta-tion of a Stressor.\u201d I believe that the concepts of stress management remain only concepts if they are not prac-ticed outside the classroom. In other words, to know and not to do is not to know. In this exercise students are asked to pick one of their top three stressors and are given two weeks to resolve it\u2014with the condition that they must enter the classroom with no bruises or broken bones. Although students are asked to write up this assignment, on the day it\u2019s due we all sit in a circle with the lights down low and, one by one, under an agree-ment of con\ufb01  dentiality, we share our stories. This par-ticular semester Allison went \ufb01  rst. \u201cMy stressor is breast cancer; it runs in the family,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy mother has had it\u2014my aunt and my grand mother, too. For many years I have been scared of \nbreast cancer, because I know I am at risk. Upon hearing this assignment, I decided it was time to go for a mam-mogram. I was extremely nervous, but last week I made an appointment with my physician.\u201d\nThe class was silent, all eyes \ufb01  xed on Allison. With an air \nof con\ufb01  dence, she concluded her story with a smile: \u201cI \nam happy to say that the test was negative!\u201dAs a graduating senior with a major in broadcast journal-\nism, Allison was looking forward to a promising broadcast-ing career. Less than a month after her graduation, she found herself working for a PBS af\ufb01  liate. Within a year\u2019s time, she took a job with Voice of America and then moved to Los Angeles to start a highly coveted job as an anchor/ reporter for Channel One, a cable program for high school youth. Several years later our paths would cross again, when I found myself in Los Angeles for a book signing.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>What wouldn\u2019 t they want to hear about? Learn people\u2019 s basic needs\nA c omponent of empathy is figuring out what drives other people. Everyone has needs that are unique to them, but most people also share a\nset of basic ones. Most people want to\nbe liked;\nbe respected;\nfeel like they\u2019re important to their friend;\nspend at least some time being social for its own sake;\nbe kept in the loop about what their close friends and family are up\nto;\nfeel like the things they have to say are interesting or entertaining;\nfeel appreciated and acknowledged for the things they do for others;\nfeel like their thoughts, emotions, and actions are healthy , reasonable,\nand normal;\nfeel understood and supported when they\u2019re going through a tough\ntime;\nbe given the benefit of the doubt when they screw up;\nnot be embarrassed or have their flaws or failures thrown in their\nface;\nfeel accomplished. Once you start considering these basic needs, you\u2019ll feel much more\nconfident about how you could act in various situations. For example, if a\nfriend is  telling you a funny sto ry , odds are they want you to se em amused\nby it, not bored. If they share a mistake they made, they don\u2019 t want you totut-tut them.

There is no better time for necessity to bear the fruits of creativity than during times of frustration when one needs to get from point A to point B. At one time, the United States took pride in its American \ningenuity. Young in age and pregnant with possibilities, early generations of Americans made more improve-ments to the proverbial mouse trap than there are stars in the sky. Before the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was a productive society, the vast major-ity of its citizens making more than 70 percent of their household items themselves. As the country became a consumer society, however, more and more items were bought rather than made at home. The availability of several new inventions, like the washer and dryer, pro-vided more leisure time. But with some of these inven-tions, lifestyles became very comfortable, and our collective creative skills became dull (Mander, 1978; Jackson, 2004). With the advent of television, it is said, the creative American mind began showing signs of atrophy. People now take a passive role in the creative process, letting other people do the important, creative thinking. Experts agree that a happy mind is a creative mind. The inability to deal with many problems is directly related to the inability to tap into and utilize creativity. It would be unfair to point the \ufb01  nger of blame solely at television. Many critics believe that the American educational system continues to play a role in the decline of creative skills as well, by sti\ufb02  ing the limits of imagination with conformity and critical-thinking skills. More over, American companies are now looking to hire Asians who are deemed more creative. The dominant style of thinking in the Western hemisphere is considered left-brained: linear, logical and rational, analytical, and judgmental. Left-brain modes of think-ing are those most rewarded in both school and work environments. And this style of thinking has devalued recreational and play time.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Are\tsome\tmore\tanimated\tthan\tothers?</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

In the longer term, the best way to get used to the\nthings th at make  you nervous is  to expose yourself to them gradually . The\nnext chapter goes into detail about this.7\nR e d u c i n g  F e a r s  a n d  I n s e c u r i t i e s  t h r o u g h\nR e a l - W o r l d  E x p e r i e n c e s\nT HE  IDEA S  IN  THE  PREVIOUS  CHAPT ERS  certainly help reduce counterproductive\nthinking. Howev er , some beliefs are hardier and will start to fad e only when\nthey\u2019ve been overwritten by contradictory real-world experiences. Sometimes you \u2019ll have a fea r or belief that you logicall y know is\ninaccurate, but it still feels  true and limits your behavior . In these  cases, analyzing and de bunking your thoughts isn\u2019 t enough. For\none, your mind won\u2019 t give much weight to the conclusions you come to. It\nresponds much more strongly to  real-life evidence, and wrong o r not, as far\nas your mind is concerned, it has past experiences that show t he belief is\nreasonable. Y ou  may feel like you\u2019ve successfully disarmed a belief, but it\nwill often return. The other problem is that when you have a fear or\ninsecurity , it can generate a nea rly endless supply of worried thoughts. If\nyou deb unk some of them, new ones will just take their place (for example,\nif you\u2019re  scared to talk to people at parties and defuse your w orries about\nbeing made fun of, you may de velop new ones about accidentally making\nsomeone angry). The bul k of this chapter covers how to get used to the social situations\nthat make you nervous. But first, it explains how real-world experiences can\naf fect yo ur mind-set about socializing and reduce insecurities and limiting\nbeliefs that don\u2019 t necessarily have a big anxiety component to them. K n o w i n g  w h y  y o u  m u s t  g a i n  f i r s t h a n d  e x p e r i e n c e sReal-life feedba ck can overwrite unhelpful beliefs, but the process is\ngradual. Say you have the belief, \u201cI\u2019m boring and people don\u2019 t enjoy my\ncompany .\u201d As you begin to polish your social skills, people will begin to\nshow you that th ey like having you around. The first few times it happens,\nyou\u2019ll probably  dismiss it as a fluke. As it keeps happening, you\u2019ll\ntentatively start to accept that some people do like your company; you may\nadopt some more self-assured behaviors, but you\u2019ll lar gely remain\nskeptical. W ith enough time, the way you see yourself will stop lagging\nbehind your actual progress, an d you\u2019ll be able to see yourself in a more\npositive light. Some traces of the original insecurity may always remain, but\nshould be easy enough to act against. The pro cess is the same for us eful attitudes like \u201cDon\u2019 t care too much\nabout what other people think.\u201d Again, you can\u2019 t instantly take on that\nmentality becau se you\u2019ve read it\u2019 s good to have. On a deepe r level, you\nmay fea r other people\u2019 s opinion of you. However , over many small\noccasions, you can choose to do  things you want to do, but may  draw some\nnegative respon ses (for example, speaking up with a less-pop ular belief,\nwearing unconv entional clothes ). As you continually experience firsthand\nthat acting that way has benefits and that you can handle the consequences,\nit slo wly reinforces the importan ce of not being overly concerned with what\nother people think of you. (\u201cWhen I made that edgy joke, one or two people\nmade m ildly uncomfortable fa ces, but it wasn\u2019 t so bad. Everyone else\nthought it was really funny . And  it just felt good not to hold back my sense\nof humor like I always used to.\u201d)\nA common piece of social advic e in this vein is to \u201cFake it \u2019 til you make\nit.\u201d That is, force yourself to act outwardly confident even though you don\u2019 t\nfeel that sure of yourself deep down; then let the positive reinforcement that\ncomes from your self-assured behavior build true confidence. This\nsuggestion has limits. Y ou may feel comfortable outwardly faking someconfident behaviors, but others will be too nerve-racking and too much of a\nleap from how you normally a ct. If you\u2019re really insecure, a nxious, and\nsocially inexperienced, you can\u2019 t slip on the persona of someone who\u2019 s\nhighly confident  just like that. However , you may be able to pul l of f smaller\ntasks, like introducing yourself t o someone at your job when you otherwise\nwould have taken a pass. T h e  i m p o r t a n c e  o f  f a c i n g  y o u r  f e a r s\nIf a soci al situation really makes  you nervous, you need to put y ourself in it\nuntil you  get comfortable with it. Y ou may never be completely unfazed by\nthe situation, but you can get to a point where your fear is low enough that\nit doesn\u2019 t keep you from going after what you want. Exposing yours elf to a fear works because it overwrites yo ur mind\u2019 s\nassociation of Situation \u2013 >  Cue to get nervous . Ho wever , to d o that, you\nneed to be aro und your fear long enough that you calm down and\nexperience firsthand you\u2019ll be okay . If you briefly put yoursel f in contact\nwith som ething scary , then bolt while you\u2019re still feeling nervous, your\nbrain hasn\u2019 t learned anything new . When it comes to situations t hat make you only mildly un easy , just\nknowing this may be enough to get you to start changing your b ehavior . For\nexample, invitin g people to han g out may make you mildly anxious to the\npoint that if you live on autopilot, you\u2019ll default to not extending invitations\nto anyon e. Once  you\u2019re aware it\u2019 s important to of fer invites, it may be easy\nenough for you to take a deep breath and go through with it. If you have a fear that\u2019 s more in tense, you need to be more strategic about\nfacing it . Psycho logists have found the most ef fective way to face a fear is\nto gradu ally expose yourself to it; this is called exposur e therapy . Y ou start\nwith a milder variation of your fear , face that until you\u2019re comf ortable with\nit, and then wor k your way up to more nerve-racking scenarios. Y ou do theexposure sessio ns frequently enough that you build up som e courage\nmomentum. For example, if you were afraid of standing on balconies, you\nwould start on so me lower floors and slowly work your way up (literally) to\nhigher ones.

It\u2019 s great to\nsteer clear of as many bad habits as possible, but don\u2019 t put too much strain\non yourself to be  flawless when you talk to people. No one gets it right 100\npercent of the ti me. Also, even if you converse in a way that most people\nfind acceptable, you\u2019ll encounte r the occasional person who ha s a dif ferent\nperspective and sees something  as a mistake on your part (for example,\nsomeone who\u2019 s overly sensitive may take of fense to normal af fectionate\nteasing). Don\u2019 t let a fear of making a mistake paralyze you. Many so-called\nmistakes aren\u2019 t ideal, but they\u2019 re not that  bad , and the conversation will\noften co ntinue ju st fine. For example, it\u2019 s not great to brag, but if you subtly\ntalk yourself up one time, most people aren\u2019 t instantly going to be turned\nof f. They may n ot even see it as bragging to begin with, just y ou stating a\nfact about yourself.If you\u2019r e just getting the hang of making conversation and are anxious\nabout getting rejected or making a bad impression, you can get so worried\nabout all  the behaviors you have  to avoid that your mind goes bl ank. Saying\nsomething less- than-perfect is often better than saying nothin g at all. At\nleast that way you\u2019re keeping the conversation going and giving the other\nperson s omething to react to. F or example, if you mildly brag  about how\ngood you are a t drawing, the other person may start talking about how\nthey\u2019re into art as well. If you catch yourself making a bigger mistake, you can usually smooth it\nover by apologizing for it. Don\u2019 t say you\u2019re sorry in too serious a tone. Just\nquickly , casually  acknowledge what you did wrong, then get on with the\ndiscussion. For example, \u201cWhoops, I just cut you of f. Sorry about that.

Mistakes\ncan be one-of f errors in judgmen t or be more habitual and stem from lar ger\nissues in a person\u2019 s personality that they need to work on. T h e  N o . 1  t h i n g  t o  r e m e m b e r  a b o u t  c o n v e r s a t i o n\nm i s t a k e s\nEveryone makes  mistakes while conversing from time to time. It\u2019 s great to\nsteer clear of as many bad habits as possible, but don\u2019 t put too much strain\non yourself to be  flawless when you talk to people. No one gets it right 100\npercent of the ti me. Also, even if you converse in a way that most people\nfind acceptable, you\u2019ll encounte r the occasional person who ha s a dif ferent\nperspective and sees something  as a mistake on your part (for example,\nsomeone who\u2019 s overly sensitive may take of fense to normal af fectionate\nteasing). Don\u2019 t let a fear of making a mistake paralyze you. Many so-called\nmistakes aren\u2019 t ideal, but they\u2019 re not that  bad , and the conversation will\noften co ntinue ju st fine. For example, it\u2019 s not great to brag, but if you subtly\ntalk yourself up one time, most people aren\u2019 t instantly going to be turned\nof f. They may n ot even see it as bragging to begin with, just y ou stating a\nfact about yourself.If you\u2019r e just getting the hang of making conversation and are anxious\nabout getting rejected or making a bad impression, you can get so worried\nabout all  the behaviors you have  to avoid that your mind goes bl ank. Saying\nsomething less- than-perfect is often better than saying nothin g at all. At\nleast that way you\u2019re keeping the conversation going and giving the other\nperson s omething to react to. F or example, if you mildly brag  about how\ngood you are a t drawing, the other person may start talking about how\nthey\u2019re into art as well. If you catch yourself making a bigger mistake, you can usually smooth it\nover by apologizing for it. Don\u2019 t say you\u2019re sorry in too serious a tone. Just\nquickly , casually  acknowledge what you did wrong, then get on with the\ndiscussion. For example, \u201cWhoops, I just cut you of f. Sorry about that. So\nyou were saying?\u201d\nK n o w i n g  w h e n  i t \u2019 s  o k a y  t o  b r e a k  t h e  r u l e s\nPeople get away with making  errors in conversations all the time. An\nobservation socially inexperienced people sometimes make is, \u201cI\u2019ve read\nabout al l these things that are su pposedly bad conversation habi ts, but I see\npopular people doing them all  the time. What gives?\u201d There  are a few\nexplanations:\nSome \u201cbad\u201d behaviors ar e okay in certain situations. As Chapter\n14 e xplained, it\u2019 s acceptable in loud, rowdy group conversations for\npeople to interrupt and talk ove r each other as they try to make  their\npoints heard. Some \u201cbad\u201d behaviors ar e accepted in particular subcultur es or\nsocial gr oups. I n a gro up of young, bro-ish guys, mild bragging may\nbe comm on and acceptable. A circle of intellectual friends may be\nfine with members correcting each other .Individuals vary in which social mistakes bother them. Someone\nwho\u2019 s n ot a big talker themse lves may have fewer issues with a\nmonopolizer . So meone with a crasser sense of humor may not mind a\nless-sensitive friend. Our friendships are partially determined by\nwhat mistakes we don\u2019 t mind, or even find endearing, in others. People\u2019 s personalities ar e somewhat defined by the minor , mostly\ntolerated mista kes they tend to make. \u201cY ep, that\u2019 s Norm, always\ntelling th ose meandering stories\u201d, \u201cMindy\u2019 s just excitable.

T rying too hard to for ce a particular dynamic: By all means, try to\nstart a certain dynamic if you think it will be enjoyable, but be\nwilling t o chang e course if the other person isn\u2019 t biting.

Monopolizing the conversation by hogging too much of thespotlight and not letting other s speak:  Although some people like\ntalking more than others, in g eneral everyone in the conversation\nshould have equal time to c ontribute. The exception is when\neveryone has clearly shown inte rest in letting you take center stage to\nshare a longer story or opinion.

Being lo ng-winded; going on and on when it\u2019 s your turn to s peak,\nrather than being mor e succinct:  Even if you have a longer point to\nshare, you should still aim to make it as concise as you can. P eople\nwill get impatient if you ramble on too much. Continually check the\nother person\u2019 s nonverbal signa ls (see Chapter 18).

Perhaps this concept is best illus-trated by the famous actor Buster Keaton (and imitated by Johnny Depp in the movie Benny and Joon) who tries in vain to pick up his hat but repeatedly seems to kick it out of his reach before he can grab it. If the conscious mind and the unconscious minds are not acting together, all the intentions and reframing in the world aren\u2019t going to help. In the \ufb01  eld of psychology this is known as the \u201cunconscious resistance,\u201d a self-sabotaging effect that undermines the conscious mind\u2019s best efforts to make (positive) things happen. It is the foundation of the negative self-ful\ufb01  lling prophecy.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Enhance\tYour\tNatural\tCommunication\tStyle\n3. Avoid\tGiving\tMixed\tSignals\n4.

The best method is to write down brief descriptions of a dream and then list as many associations with the symbolic images that come to mind. For example, viewing a plane crash from a farmer\u2019s \ufb01  eld could be associated with one\u2019s career, a relationship, driving a car, or a new diet. The more associations that can be made, the greater the chance for a solid connection. Dream therapist Robert Johnson, in his book Inner \nWork, states that the second phase is to draw parallels with these associations by asking yourself a series of questions. For example, What do I have in common with that image? Have I seen this image in my waking state? What behavior(s) do I have that is like that por-trayed in this image? What emotional response does this dream image elicit, and what circumstances in everyday life elicit this same emotional response? The third phase of the interpretation process is to select \nthe interpretation that seems to be most relevant to your life at that moment. The best choice can also be made by asking questions such as the following: What is the central message of the dream? Did the dream have any advice or moral to it? When choosing a dream interpretation, con-sider each possibility a viable one because the ego-con-trolled conscious mind tends to protect itself from that which is un\ufb02  attering or potentially harmful to itself. Dream expert Ann Faraday advises looking at the dream from someone else\u2019s perspective to allow a greater expan-sion of possibilities to choose from. Then, make a selection with your heart, not solely with your analytical mind. Dream interpretation is still an art form, not a science, \nand the true interpretation rests solely with the dreamer. However, Johnson\u2019s advice to get the best results is, \ufb01  rst, \nto consider as an interpretation something you don\u2019t already know; second, to avoid interpretations that in\ufb02 ate the ego; and third, to disregard dream interpre-\ntations that pass blame from you to someone or some-thing else. Also, be careful to consider only the obvious because dream symbols look different from various per-spectives. Finally, Johnson says, dream interpretation is useless if it is not acted upon. Each dream, no matter how obvious its relevance, is a message\u2014and messages that are ignored may prolong the stress associated with them. It is up to the dreamer to grasp the message and resolve the issue that inspired it. Just as dreams reveal messages to the conscious mind, they \ncan also be used as drills to tap the wealth of knowledge hidden beneath consciousness for advice when dealing with problems, a practice dating back to ancient Greece. This process, called dream incubation, has been explored \nby researcher Gayle Delaney. To incubate a dream, a per-son ponders a speci\ufb01  c concern or issue by asking a ques-tion and perhaps even writing it down before going to sleep. Upon awaking, he or she writes down whatever images come to mind, and then follows the process of \nDream therapy experts believe \nthat the more we try to remem-\nber our dreams, the better we are able to deal with problems in our waking state.

From her research, Delaney has found this technique to be very effective in the resolu-tion of stressful issues. It can be combined with journal writing to augment the awareness process. Lucid dreaming is the ability to enter the dream state \nwhile still conscious. As in the practice of Jung\u2019s active imagination or creative visualization, in lucid dreaming you consciously choose to add aspects of your dream while in the waking state. In essence, you direct the script of your dream. Lucid dreaming is often practiced to \ufb01  nish dream fragments or to provide an ending to a recurring dream. When utilized effectively, dreams offer a wealth of \nknowledge that begs to be addressed during the hours of conscious thought. To ignore the advice, to waste this resource, to leave inaccessible the knowledge of the unconscious mind only perpetuates the perceptions, emo-tions, and behaviors associated with stress. The impor-tance of dreams cannot be overstated; they have proved many times over to provide a means of mental stability. Or, as Jung stated in his book Man and His Symbols, \u201cOne \ncannot afford to be naive about dreams.\u201d\nPrayer and Faith\nPrayer is one of the oldest and most commonly used cop-ing mechanisms known to humankind. In its simplest form, prayer is thought: a desire of the heart, and often a call for help in what can best be described as a plea for divine intervention. Although prayer is not synonymous with meditation, these two processes share many similar-ities in that they both initiate a process of centering, increased concentration, and connectedness. They differ in that as a coping technique, prayer speci\ufb01  cally elicits the element of divine intervention. It is a request, whereas meditation can encompass many modes of thinking and is not speci\ufb01  cally limited to divine thought (see Chapter 18). Studies by Manfredi and Pickett (1987) and Koenig (1988) report that prayer is the most common coping style used by the elderly, especially when dealing with issues related to death. Schafer (1992) writes that prayer can lower anxiety, increase optimism, and instill hope in the individual.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>There are in fact times when we cannot complete a \ntask alone.

If you\u2019re making an ef fort to\nbecome better friends with som eone and you get the sense you\u2019re putting\nmore en er gy int o it than they are, consider backing of f and adjusting your\nexpectations.

Just as many\nhave frie ndships where the bond grew more gradually . Neither progression\nis be tter than th e other . Friendships can get of f the ground quickly in the\nfollowing situations:\nwhen you just click with a person unusually well;\nwhen yo u\u2019re bo th at a place in your lives where you\u2019re looking for\nnew friends (for example, during the first weeks of college);\nwhen you\u2019re both available and easily accessible to each other (for\nexample, you live in the same building and have lots of free time to\nhang out);\nwhen you fulfill an unmet need in each other \u2019 s lives (for exa mple,\nyou absolutely love reading and  discussing books, but none of  your\nother friends care much about them);\nwhen you\u2019re in a situation whe re the usual standards for frien dship\nprogression don\u2019 t apply , like when you meet people while trav eling\nand feel like friends for life after knowing them for only five days. Friendships can grow more slowly\nwhen on e or both of you are pretty busy with your day-to-day livesand/or already have many friends who fill up your calendar;\nwhen yo u get along well enough, but there isn\u2019 t that instant spa rk of\nintense compatibility;\nwhen you\u2019re not actively trying to deepen your friendship with them. For example, they\u2019re on the per iphery of your social circle, and  you\nget to know them better here and there. It\u2019 s natural to feel a bit awkward and insecur e as a new friendship\nbegins\nThere ar e times when you\u2019ll hit  it of f with someone right away and never\nfeel uncomforta ble around them. There are also those times where your\nfriendships will develop in a low-stakes, almost accidental way . However ,\nsometimes the process is more nerve-racking, like if you meet someone at a\none-of f event and then actively try to start a friendship with them. Here it\u2019 s\nunderstandable t hat things will feel uncertain because you\u2019re not sure how\nmuch they like y ou or if you\u2019ll continue to get along and have things to say\nto each other .

W ith tim e, friendships can even develop between people who were initially\nindif ferent to each other . Make an effort to hang out with them r egularly\nThe main way to  spend enough time with someone is to hang out with them\nfairly often.

If not, you should try to use the ideas in t he previous\nchapter to or ganize get-togethe rs so you can continue seeing them.

This step needs to be ongoing . It\u2019 s not about coordinating a one-time\nhangout. It\u2019 s about putting in th e ef fort to keep seeing them c ontinuously\nover a period of months.

The word sarcasm means \u201cto tear \ufb02  esh,\u201d \nand if you have ever borne the brunt of sarcasm, then you know all too well that this is a \ufb01  gurative \nyet accurate description. Although sarcasm may share elements with clever wit, it reveals latent anger (see Chapter 4). It is an attempt to get ver-bal revenge. Sarcasm is perceived by its users to be a socially acceptable way to express hostile feel-ings through words rather than physical aggres-sion, but words can hurt as much, if not more, than physical abuse, and the memory of it far exceeds that of physical pain. A sarcastic remark is typically followed by the punch line, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding,\u201d to take the sharp edge off the potential pain in\ufb02  icted. Sarcasm is the lowest form of \nhumor. Although sarcastic remarks may seem funny, they  \nactually induce stress rather than \nrelieve it in the person toward whom they are aimed. For this reason, sarcasm is not advocated as a vehicle for expressing humor. Almost every-one employs it to some extent, but its use should be minimized if not altogether abandoned. Although types of humor have been compartmental-ized into various categories here, for the most part, in practice they mix and blend together to form a score of permutations. Examples would be a sarcastic joke about death, or a parody of slapstick. It is equally dif\ufb01  cult to \nneatly categorize senses of humor, or why individuals laugh at what they do. Senses of Humor\nJust as there is more than one type of humor, experts of humor research have identi\ufb01  ed several senses of humor. Senses of humor appear to be a function of one\u2019s upbring-ing and collective environments. Quite possibly, each individual has the makings for all the senses of humor, but one type tends to dominate in each personality. For this reason, it is complicated to give general advice on ways to improve one\u2019s sense of humor. In his book Laugh after Laugh , Dr. Raymond Moody identi\ufb01  es four catego-\nries describing most people\u2019s senses of humor:\n 1. Conventional. In the conventional sense of humor, two or more people \ufb01  nd common ground by \nsharing a similar humorous perception and laughing at the same thing. Laughter occurs with someone, not at someone. There is a mutual appreciation for things that appear universally funny.

Are they there to make\nnew friends, or do they plan to stick to the group they came with? Don\u2019t place too much importance on how well you socialize at parties\nParties a re just one way people get together . For the average p erson, they\ncome up  only occasionally . They can be fun and lively , but the y\u2019re not the\nbe-all an d end-all of social inte raction. Some people blow the significance\nof p arties out of proportion and measure how well they get alo ng with the\nstrangers they meet as the ultimate test of their social worthiness. If it\u2019 s\nimportant to you to be able to mingle, then you should work on it. But at the\nsame time, know that plenty of people have great social lives even if\nworking the room and being me morable at big gatherings isn\u2019 t their strong\npoint. Regarding the expectation that  you have to have a caaah-raaazy time,\nmany people\u2019 s idea of a good night at a party is to mainly hang out with the\nfriends they came with in a low-key way , have a couple of drinks, and\nmaybe chat with a person or two they don\u2019 t know . They don\u2019 t feel they\u2019ve\nfailed if they ha ven\u2019 t done a bunch of keg stands, jumped of f a  roof into a\npool, and made twenty new buddies.Deciding the best time to arrive\nHow ea rly or late you show up at a party can influence how comfortable\nyou feel socializing with the other guests. Some people find it\u2019 s good to\narrive ea rly (not  overly early , of  course, because that can inconvenience the\nhost). Fewer guests will have arrived, and you can talk to everyone under\nmore low-key circumstances an d in smaller , more manageable groups. As\nthe other guests trickle in, you can get to know them as they arrive. However , this doesn\u2019 t work for everyone. Some people feel more exposed\nand on the spot if they\u2019re at a party early with hardly anyone e lse. It\u2019 s also\nless of an option if you don\u2019 t know the host(s) that well. The other option is to arrive later , when you\u2019ll have lots of existing groups\nto join. Y ou may also like that you can disappear into the crowd and not feel\nlike you  stand out. If you find a conversation awkward, you can quickly\nescape t o someo ne else, rather than, say , being stuck having to chat with\njust the host and her two good friends for twenty minutes. There are\ndownsides to this approach too. Some people find a room full of  guests who\nare alrea dy talking to each other intimidating. Everyone may b e into their\nconversations, a nd groups can fe el harder to break into. Finally , as the night\ngoes on, people get more rowdy , which may not be your style. W ays to appr oach and chat with people at parties\nPrevious chapters covered how to feel comfortable approaching  people and\nhow to start and  maintain conversations with them, so this section won\u2019 t\nrepeat all of th at. Here are some party-specific ideas for getting into\ninteractions:\nIf you\u2019re going to mingle with strangers on your own, you can t alk to\nwhomever you want to. Pick a person who\u2019 s close to you, or who\nseems interesting or approachable, or just go up to someone atrandom. That may sound too s imple, but you really don\u2019 t ne ed to\nthink about it more than that. Ask the person throwing the p arty to introduce you to ever yone. (This isn\u2019 t always an option, though.)\nGive yo urself a role, like the person who takes people\u2019 s coats and\nshows them where the snacks and drinks are. Join one  of the activities that m ay be going on (for example, a card\ngame, a group watching TV or playing video games in the basement). Initiate a new a ctivity to get people talking, like playing a board\ngame or drinking game (if it\u2019 s  the type of get-together where  that\nwould be appropriate). T wo appr oaches to mingling\nThe first approach to mingling is to be more mechanical and try to have at\nleast a brief con versation with everyone at the event. The seco nd is to go\nwith the  flow , talk to whoever catches your fancy , and see whe re the night\ntakes you. Y ou might end up in a  bunch of short interactions, or you may hit\nit of f with the second group you talk to and spend the rest of the party with\nthem. The try-to-talk-to-everyone approach is more appropriate if you\u2019re hosting\nthe e vent; it\u2019 s expected of you to be polite and say hello to everyone. Y ou\u2019d\nalso use it if it\u2019 s important for you to meet everyone there, or if the party\nhas a business o r networking component and you want to be s ure to make\nthe rounds and talk to everyone  you need to. The more casual approach is\nbest when you\u2019re attending a big ger , purely social party . In thos e situations,\nmost of the gue sts won\u2019 t try to speak to everyone else because it\u2019 s often\nimpractical and would get in the way of their spontaneous fun. Leaving the partySome people find leaving part ies awkward. If you don\u2019 t like  seemingly\nbeing the center of attention as  you announce you\u2019re heading out, that\u2019 s\nsimply somethin g you can get used to in time. If you\u2019re not sure how to say\nyour good-byes,  it\u2019 s polite to let at least the host(s) and your good friends\nknow yo u\u2019re taking of f. If you\u2019ve met some new people you\u2019d like to stay\nin to uch with, y ou can track th em down and get their contact info before\nyou go. Don\u2019 t feel you have to  tell every last guest you\u2019re done for the\nnight. W hoever you tell, just sa y you\u2019re heading of f and don\u2019 t think you\nhave to  have a five-minute g oing-away chat. There\u2019 s no need to act\nsheepish if you\u2019re leaving early .</DOCUMENT>", "question": "2.

Changing factors in your environment might include driving a different route to work or blocking out time periods during the day dur-ing which you do not answer the phone so as to get a major task completed. In situations where you change speci\ufb01  c factors, you attempt to manipulate or control \nyour environment so that your encounters with poten-tial stressors are minimal. To change your environment means relocating from unhealthy or intolerable living conditions to a new setting that is conducive to better health status. Because changing one\u2019s environment is both costly and time consuming, this approach is often used as a last resort. Keep in mind that if you choose to change your environment so as to avoid people or run away, then this coping technique is being used improp-erly and no resolution is guaranteed. Also, recall from Chapter 1 that Holmes and Rahe found that relocating to a new environment is a stressful experience in itself. On a larger scale, social orchestration can be seen in many \npolitical grass-roots efforts\u2014lobbying Congress to pass legislation favoring particular issues and concerns, for example. In fact, social o rchestration is the coping skill of \nchoice at both local and national governmental levels for issues such as land\ufb01  lls and recycling. On a smaller scale, social o rchestration is a strategy we employ regularly with \npersonal chores and responsibilities, but it is an effective one in the management of major life stressors. A prime example of social orchestration where factors in \nthe environment were changed for all Americans was the fallout from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In Manhattan, commuter train routes were disrupted for months, as were some roads and highways leading into the city, which changed going to and coming home from work into a challenge. Many people learned to telecom-mute and actually found they preferred this style of work. Many businesses whose locations were either devastated in the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings or closed because of smoke and falling ash needed to open temporary of\ufb01  ces in outlying areas. Perhaps one of the biggest changes that affected the U.S. population related to air travel, when new security checks required addi-tional hours of time before take-off, readjusting time schedules for everyone involved.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Additional examples include changes made by those who lost their homes dur-ing Hurricane Katrina and the southern California wild-\ufb01 res of 2007. Whether it\u2019s reorchestrating your life \nbecause of a new addition to the family (e.g., new baby or aging parents) or some world event that landed on your doorstep, social orchestration offers a way to gain an upper hand in the situation. Although social o rchestration is often the coping skill of \nchoice for large-scale issues like earthquakes and \nhuman-made disasters, the ability to change factors in the environment can be done at a personal level as well. Many coping skills are used at the same time to deal with a stressor; there is strength in numbers. Thus, social o rchestration m ay incorporate the use of other \ncoping skills, including assertiveness, cognitive restruc-turing, creative problem solving, and time manage-ment. Cognitive restructuring is essential to create a new frame of mind in which to manipulate factors in the environment. The following is a step-by-step pro-cess for social orchestration:\n 1. De\ufb01  ne your stressors. Write down what is bother -\ning you by trying to describe what this stressor\n \nreally is (e.g., an obnoxious roommate, a bad mar-riage, car repair problems). 2.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Intrigued with the use of humor as a healing agent, \nDr. Raymond Moody surveyed several history books in 1978 to discover the following. In the year 1260, a pro-gressive French physician, Henri de Moundeville, saw the important relationship between positive emotions and sound health, and made a practice of allowing fam-ily and friends to cheer and joke with their sick rela-tives. He wrote, \u201cLet the surgeon take care to regulate the whole regimen of the patient\u2019s life for joy and hap-piness.\u201d European monarchs also saw the importance of laughter, and often employed court jesters (those guys with funny shoes) to add mirth to their castle courts. Perhaps the most renowned court jester was Richard Tarlton, who was credited with keeping British Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603) in better health than did her team of physicians. But laughter has not always been looked upon with \nfavor. Europeans in the Middle Ages and Puritans on the eastern shores of North America, among others, perceived laughter to be the work of the devil. People caught laughing out loud were often denounced as witches or believed to be possessed by Satan. The expres-sion of humor was considered a sin in many Christian denominations. Other comments from those days about laughter (Moody, 1978):\nLaughter on any occasion is immoral and indecent. Laughter obscures truth, hardens the heart, and stu-pe\ufb01 es understanding. A man of parts of fashion is therefore only seen to smile, but never heard to laugh. \u2014Lord Chester\ufb01  eld, 1748\nAnd if you look at the portraits of European nobility \ncommissioned over a period of several hundred years, you are hard-pressed to \ufb01  nd anyone smiling (except perhaps the Mona Lisa). The words \u201csay cheese\u201d were not coined for use with the \n\ufb01 rst camera in the nineteenth century, either; people were \nafraid of being caught sinning in public (\nFIG. 12.1  /H17076).</DOCUMENT>", "question": "3.

{"instruction": "<DOCUMENT>These \u201ccontacts\u201d often prove stressful because of the nature of our com-municative interactions. Experts indicate that the aver-age person spends approximately three-quarters of his or her waking day communicating with others. Included under the rubric of communication are phone calls, emails, text messaging, blogging, lectures, staff meet-ings, dinner conversations, listening to radio and televi-sion, and simply talking with friends and acquaintances. The degree of perception and interpretation required for communication, and the many layers of meaning in even common words, leaves much room for misunder-standing\u2014and hence stress. This is why the practice of good communication skills is so important to help mini-mize and resolve misunderstandings. Good communi-cation skills are essential as a coping technique. To be a good communicator, one must not only express thoughts and feelings in understandable words, but also listen, clarify, and process information as it is intended. Communication skills are so important in the business world that workshops and seminars are given regularly on this topic; poor communication skills are simply not cost-effective. As you will see in this chapter, almost every theory and accompanying skill is based on com-mon sense. Yet common sense is often bound and gagged when the ego is threatened.

The time for each stage will vary depending on the person as well as the magni-tude of loss. Feelings of loss, sadness, anger, pain, and fear are all natural, but not for prolonged periods of time. To deny these feelings is unhealthy, just as it is abnormal to prolong these feelings beyond their pur-pose. Brief grief is a strategy to allocate the correct amount of time to the grieving process (\ufb01  nding mean-\ning in the suffering) and then move on to personal reso-lution and growth. When many people are introduced to the concept of cognitive restructuring, they incor-rectly sense they must adopt a \u201cPollyanna\u201d or cheerful attitude and that grief is not an appropriate sensation to acknowledge. As a result, they reject the entire idea of looking at the \u201cbrighter side\u201d of a situation. Until feel-ings of suffering, no matter how big or small, are brought to awareness, it will be dif\ufb01  cult to adopt a new frame of mind. Frankl wrote that even in suffering there can be tragic optimism; the discovery of light-hearted moments and personal meaning in the saddest of times. Even in the death-grip of the concentration camp, Frankl found it possible to laugh at many of life\u2019s absurdities. Moments like these helped him get through his ordeal. In her classic book Minding the Body, Mending the Mind, \nBorysenko refers to the preponderance of negative \nthoughts as awfulizing. The process of awfulizing con-sists of judgmental and analytical thoughts that greatly narrow one\u2019s perspective and put our mental processes into a shallow, one-track mode. The result is what Borysenko calls regressive coping, a nonproductive cop-ing skill. Awful izing creates worst-case scenarios for every situation.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

Laughter appears to have both short-term and long-term effects on the body\u2019s major physiological systems. In the short term, a bout of laugh-ter appears to initiate the stress response, with a slight increase in heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and ventilations. But this is quickly followed by a rebound  effect, where these parameters decrease to below previous resting levels. The overall effect is a pro-found level of homeostasis, much like that seen when progressive muscular relaxation is practiced. In the short term, laughter is credited with stabilizing blood pressure, \u201cmassaging\u201d vital organs, stimulating circula-tion, facilitating digestion, and increasing oxygenated blood throughout the body. As Fry (1986) stated, \u201cLaughter is clearly related to the reduction of stress and the physical symptoms related to stress.\u201d\nFry also conducted a series of studies on the composi-\ntion of tears, those shed from pain and laughter as well as those arti\ufb01  cially induced (e.g., from cutting onions). His research revealed that the constituents of emotional teardrops include a greater percentage of proteins and toxins than those produced arti\ufb01  cially. Fry concluded that tears resulting from emotional responses serve to rid the body of stress-related toxins. Once again, this suggests that physical expressions\u2014both laughter and crying\u2014are natural and healthy to the well-being of the individual. As author Kurt Vonnegut once quipped (Klein, 1989), \u201cLaughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.\u201d\nPerhaps more impressive than the short-term effects of \nlaughter are its long-term effects. Through the new multi discipline of PNI, researchers are now \ufb01  nding \nthat the immune system plays an ever-increasing role in the mind-body relationship. In the words of Bernie Siegel (1986), \u201cThoughts are chemicals; they can either kill or cure.\u201d It appears that thoughts and perceptions are quickly transformed in the brain into chemical reac-tions that have impact throughout the body. Negative thoughts actually trigger the neural release of the stress hormones and suppress the immune system. Positive thoughts strengthen the integrity of the immune system by inducing the release of special neuropeptides from the pituitary gland and other tissues located throughout the body. Neuro peptides\u2014endorphins, interleukins, and interferons, to name a few\u2014act as messenger mol-ecules to various  organs throughout the body. Recent research has revealed that neuropeptides are also \nmanufactured and released by the lymph nodes and other components of the immune systems (see Chapter 3). Although only 60 neuropeptides have been discovered to date, scientists believe there may be several more acting in the interest of the body\u2019s immune system. In effect, laughter causes the body to produce its own pain killers. A study by David McClelland (McClelland and Kirshit, 1989) measured changes in secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA), a salivary immune-defense agent, as a result of three emotional responses (humor, cynicism, and trust) elicited by three types of movies.

As mentioned in Chapter 7 with regard to Einstein\u2019s view of spirituality, the most famous study on prayer was conducted by Randolph Byrd involving prayers for cardiac patients. Shying away from the word pray, researchers have coined the more scienti\ufb01  c term \u201cintercessory distant healing.\u201d To date, \nByrd\u2019s study has been replicated several times (Sicher and Targ, 1998; Harris et al., 1999), showing statistical signi\ufb01  cance beyond pure chance. A recent investigation into the ef\ufb01  cacy of prayer by Herbert Benson and colleagues (2006) at Harvard Medical Center found that intercessory prayer had no effect on cardiac bypass patients. Conversely, David Hodge from Arizona State University compiled empir-ical data from more than 17 recent studies on interces-sory prayer. Based on 12 criteria, he concluded that as an experimental intervention, prayer indeed had a small but signi\ufb01  cant effect. Prayer as a mode of compassion-ate intentionality is now being studied by several researchers including Marilyn Schlitz of the Institute of Noetic Sciences and Lynn McTaggart, author of the book The Intention Experiment (2007).

Best Application of Journal Writing\nGood-quality journal writing has several purposes. The \ufb01 rst is to act as a personal sounding board\u2014to cleanse \nthe mind overloaded with perceptions, emotions, and toxic thoughts. Journal writing is a great way to vent anger. In moments of rage, a verbal description helps pinpoint how and why these feelings are surfacing. Sometimes writing how you feel, and perhaps what you should have said or would like to say, becomes a draft script to resolve issues between you and the person(s) involved in your perceived stress. Writing down feel-ings of anxiety and apprehension is a good release of emotions that can drain your energy. Effective coping involves the ability to access and employ both internal and external resources. The second purpose is to map out strategies for resolu-\ntion, both attitudinal perceptions and behavioral changes. Depending on the situation, these two pur-poses can be used as an offensive tactic in the face of stress, or in strategic planning when in momentary retreat. As an offensive tactic, journal writing can be used to cope with an immediate problem. Just by pull-ing out a pad of paper and pen and writing down what is on your mind, thoughts become organized and order begins to emerge from chaos. In many stressful events, however, this option is not possible. Then journal writ-ing can be used as a postponed coping response, perhaps at the end of the day, to collect your thoughts and pro-cess major events\u2014those chronic stressors\u2014that need attention. Last, a periodic review of journal entries serves to increase awareness of trends and patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Recognition of trends is the \ufb01  rst step in changing undesired or negative thoughts and actions in an effort to reach your highest human potential and enjoy inner peace. Although the primary resource needed for journal writing is a single notebook, you might consider having two: one very private one to be used exclusively at home, and a second one, perhaps less structured, to be used at work. Personal computers have added a whole new dimen-\nsion to journal writing that was inconceivable just two decades ago. Many people have found that using a word processor actually allows them to write as fast as they think, thereby enabling them to capture the essence of several thoughts simultaneously, rather than \ufb01  ghting to retrieve some. If you \ufb01  nd it easier to type entries in a personal computer \ufb01  le than in a note-book, give it a try. 240\n56147_CH10_229_243.indd   24056147_CH10_229_243.indd   240 9/29/08   11:07:17 PM9/29/08   11:07:17 PM241 Journal Writing\nI Journal writing has been used as a form of self-\nexpression and soul searching for centuries. Psycho-logists and health educators have advocated journal writing for decades as a means to increase self-awareness on issues that need attention. I Journal writing is said to promote emotional catharsis when thoughts, perceptions, attitudes, values, beliefs, and the tensions these create are allowed to work themselves out on paper. I Use of soul searching is no coincidence as a stress-management technique because this activity is the epitome of the emptying process. I There are short-term and long-term effects of habitual journal writing. Short-term bene\ufb01  ts \ninclude releasing pent-up feelings of anger and anxiety. When a series of journal entries is reread, long-term effects include seeing patterns and habits of thought, perceptions, and behaviors that are not detectable on an entry-to-entry basis. Putting thoughts down on paper also widens one\u2019s perspective to become more receptive to solutions and resolutions to stressors. I An additional bene\ufb01  t, demonstrated by \nPennebaker, is that writing about personal expe-riences in a journal increases the integrity of the immune system. Expressive writing has also proved to bene\ufb01  t \ufb01 bromyalsia patients, wives of \nU.S. servicemen, as well as decrease resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels. I Not all journal entries have to be written in prose form. Poetry therapy is likened to making order out of personal chaos. This coping style is used in many settings, including prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, and counseling centers. I There is no wrong way to write a journal, save writing too infrequently. This chapter gave a number of guidelines for effective journal writ-ing, including several themes (Buzan, dreams, and unsent letters) that can add variety to your repertoire of entry styles.SUMMARY\nSTUDY GUIDE QUESTIONS\n 1.

Verbal and written communication is more com-plex than meets the ear or eye. The key to interpersonal communication can be \nsummed up as: Say what you mean, and mean what you say. In other words, be direct. Implementing this rule in our conversational style, however, is extremely dif\ufb01  cult. One reason confusion arises is that there are many con-cepts, ideas, and particularly feelings that are dif\ufb01  cult to \narticulate within the limits of vocabulary. Thoughts, like color photographs, can often be described only in black-and-white terms, leaving many details to assump-tion, interpretation, and imagination. Some thoughts cannot be expressed in words at all, and the words we choose to describe the contents of our conscious minds can limit our own understanding of what we wish to express as well. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, created to explain the use \nof words, suggests that our perception of reality is \nlargely based on the depth of the vocabulary in which we express ourselves. In other words, our vocabulary limits our understanding of our current reality. So, someone with a limited vocabulary will have a more dif\ufb01 cult time expressing him- or herself, as is easily \nillustrated when learning a new language. Even when vocabulary does appear to describe thoughts adequately, words are often used to camou\ufb02  age true feelings in an \nattempt to avoid hurting others or even ourselves. The inability to express how we really feel can also promote unacknowledged anxiety. Encoding: The process in which the speaker \nattempts to frame his or her thoughts and percep-tions into words.

The time for each stage will vary depending on the person as well as the magni-tude of loss. Feelings of loss, sadness, anger, pain, and fear are all natural, but not for prolonged periods of time. To deny these feelings is unhealthy, just as it is abnormal to prolong these feelings beyond their pur-pose. Brief grief is a strategy to allocate the correct amount of time to the grieving process (\ufb01  nding mean-\ning in the suffering) and then move on to personal reso-lution and growth. When many people are introduced to the concept of cognitive restructuring, they incor-rectly sense they must adopt a \u201cPollyanna\u201d or cheerful attitude and that grief is not an appropriate sensation to acknowledge. As a result, they reject the entire idea of looking at the \u201cbrighter side\u201d of a situation. Until feel-ings of suffering, no matter how big or small, are brought to awareness, it will be dif\ufb01  cult to adopt a new frame of mind. Frankl wrote that even in suffering there can be tragic optimism; the discovery of light-hearted moments and personal meaning in the saddest of times. Even in the death-grip of the concentration camp, Frankl found it possible to laugh at many of life\u2019s absurdities. Moments like these helped him get through his ordeal. In her classic book Minding the Body, Mending the Mind, \nBorysenko refers to the preponderance of negative \nthoughts as awfulizing. The process of awfulizing con-sists of judgmental and analytical thoughts that greatly narrow one\u2019s perspective and put our mental processes into a shallow, one-track mode. The result is what Borysenko calls regressive coping, a nonproductive cop-ing skill. Awful izing creates worst-case scenarios for every situation.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "5.

It\u2019 s good to have several approaches ready to go, and if one\ndoesn\u2019 t w ork, yo u can try anothe r . Y ou can also switch up broad approaches\nwithin a  single conversation as it evolves. Y ou don\u2019 t have to app ly only one\nstrategy to every person or situation. The broad conversation goals th at were covered earlier in the chapter are\none way  to give yourself some direction (\u201cI\u2019m going to ask about their\ninterests and try to find one we have in common,\u201d \u201cMy grandpa is\ninterested to know what I\u2019ve be en up to lately , so I\u2019ll focus on  telling him\nwhat\u2019 s b een new in my life since I last saw him\u201d). Here are some other\napproaches you can use:\nAppr oach #1: Be inter ested in and curious about other people, and\nmake it your goal to find out what\u2019 s fascinating and unique about them\nThis is the most popular general  approach you\u2019ll hear people me ntion when\nit comes to making conversation. It comes up again and again, going back\nto classic books on people skills like How to W in Fr iends and Influence\nPeople . Th e ide a is primarily to be som eone who asks questions and li stens\nto the answers, which leads to focusing the discussion on the other person. Y our \u201cmission\u201d in the convers ation is to discover what makes the other\nperson interesting. Y ou don\u2019 t need to only listen to  or talk about the other person the entire\ntime; yo u should bring up things about yourself and share  your own\nopinions when relevant. Generally focus the conversation on your partner ,\nbut not to the po int where you share nothing about yourself an d become afor gettable nonentity that just helps other people talk. The underlying assumption abou t this approach is that everyone\u2019 s favorite\nsubject is themselves, and that people like someone who take s a genuine\ninterest in them and the things they have to say . People also tend to feel\ngood ab out a conversation in which they can talk about aspects of\nthemselves that they\u2019re proud o f and passionate about. Another line you\u2019ll\noften he ar in regard to this strategy is that you\u2019ll be more succe ssful taking\nan in terest in other people than you will be by trying to get them interested\nin you. This approach predisposes you to adopt a positive, friendly frame of\nmind. It s basic premise implies that everyone is worth talking to if you dig\npast any preconceptions you ma y have of them. And because you\u2019re likely\nto find somethin g interesting about the other person if you look for it, it\nends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy . Appr oach #2: T alk in terms of the other person\u2019 s inter ests\nFocusing on the other person\u2019 s interests is similar to the approach above, in\nthat you\u2019re mainly listening and  the conversation is based around the other\nperson and things they like discussing. This approach is not exactly the\nsame. The approach above is more general and is about finding people\u2019 s\ngood traits, whatever they may be. This one is more about specifically\ntrying to find out what the other person is interested in talking about,\nwhether it\u2019 s a hobby or a life decision they\u2019re wrestling with, and centering\nthe con versation on that. Y ou take an interest in their interest, ask\nthoughtful questions, and listen as they tell you about it. The limitations of being an interested listenerBoth of these listening / other -person-centric approaches can work very\nwell and  are essential to have in your toolbox. At the same t ime, their\nef fectiveness is sometimes oversold.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Emotional roadblocks. The primary emotion act-ing as an obstacle to creativity is fear\u2014fear of making a mistake, fear of the unknown, and fear of rejection, once others \ufb01  nd out about past mis-\ntakes. When people say they are not creative, many times what they are really saying is, \u201cI am afraid of failure.\u201d Fear of failure can paralyze the creative thought process. Fears are natural, but with a little work they can be alleviated or resolved to enhance creativity. Conversely, sometimes we fall so deeply \u201cin love\u201d with an idea we have given birth to that we become blind to its true value or contribution. In these cases it is often best to \u201csit on\u201d the ideas, and give them time to hatch and prove their merit.</DOCUMENT>", "question": "1.

Most people who go to clubs are good, regular folk. If you\u2019ve been\ndragged to a clu b, it\u2019 s easy to think that everyone but you is empty-headed\nand lives for that kind of scene, but a lot of people are occasional club-\ngoers, who may have been cajoled into going too.

The Creative Process\nThe creative process is not complex, but it is wonder-\nfully profound because there are so many possible ways to get from point A to point B. During the 1980s, intense interest in the human creative process developed. And like the goose that was cut open to \ufb01  nd out how she laid the golden egg, the creative process has since been exam-ined from every side, angle, and perspective, and has been dissected and inspected. Unlike the goose, though, the process wasn\u2019t killed; instead, it has become well understood so that the creative muscle could \ufb02  ex with \nstrength, power, and agility for the whim and bene\ufb01  t of \nthose anxious to use it. The creative process has two parts, which by no coinci-\ndence match the functions of the right and left hemi-spheres of the human brain. Remember that Maslow (1987) observed a number of characteristics contributing to total well-being, or as he called it, self-actualization. Creativity was among these characteristics. In his later work on self-actualization, Maslow concluded that the creative process and the path to self-actualization were one and the same. He called the creative process the \u201cart of being happily lost in the present moment.\u201d He divided the creative process into primary and secondary parts. Primary creativity is the origin of ideas: the playground of the mind where ideas are generated and hatched. Secondary creativity describes the strategic plan to bring to fruition the ideas brought forth in primary creativity. Secondary creativity is like the mind\u2019s workshop: a place to saw, chisel, glue, hammer, and polish ideas. Players on the Creativity Team\nCreative consultant Roger von Oech took Maslow\u2019s idea one step further, dividing primary and secondary creativ-ity each into two phases. In his celebrated book from 1986, A Kick in the Seat of the Pants , von Oech\u2019s model of creative \nthinking includes a team of four players\u2014the explorer, artist, judge, and warrior. The explorer and artist provide \nprimary creativity, and the judge and warrior provide sec-ondary creativity. The explorer and artist team together for what von Oech calls the germination phase of creativ-ity. In this phase, inspiration and imagination are used to their fullest potential. The germination phase involves soft, pliable, right-brain thinking. Examples of this think-ing style include irrationality, nonlinear perceptions, syn-thesis, metaphor, dreams, humor, and global awareness. The judge and warrior join forces in the harvesting of the creative crops sowed in the depths of imagination. The harvest phase of creativity involves hard, critical, left-brain thinking. Examples include logic, rationality, linear anal-ysis, and factual thinking. Each type of thinking style has an equal responsibility in the creative process. The key is to let each player do its job without inter ference from the other three. In the footsteps of von Oech, Charles M. Johnson, founder of the Institute for Creative Develop-ment, delineates the creative process as a combination of creative differentiation and creative integration. Like von Oech, he divides the creative process into four stages: (1) incubation, (2) inspiration, (3) perspiration, and (4) administration (Johnson, 2005). The overall goal of creative thought is to sharpen the \nskills of all four team players so that one or two aspects don\u2019t overpower the others, cause them to atrophy, and sti\ufb02 e the entire process.
